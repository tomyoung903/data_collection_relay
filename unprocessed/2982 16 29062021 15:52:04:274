user: Hi! Are you free now? 
system: Of course! I'm always free to help out. 
user: Great. I am moving but I'm so confused with all the options I have. 
system: Don't worry. What are you deciding between? 
user: I'll be going to Cambridge and I'm so excited since it's my first time so I can't wait but for the life of me I can't decide on anything. There are just too many options and I'm also constrained by my spending capability 
system: I see. Don't worry, we can go through this together. What are your plans so far?
