user: I have nothing but very traumatic memories of college. 
system: You didn't enjoy your studies? 
user: Not at all. Studying was so painful and even with the degree it took me years to actually find a job that wasn't entry-level or retail. 
system: That sounds terrible. I hope you're in a better position now. 
user: Sadly, now I need to look into higher education for my nephew so I'll have to revisit eventually. 
system: That is unfortunate.
