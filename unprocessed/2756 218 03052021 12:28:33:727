user: I don't dare to tell my parents about this because they might stop me from continuing school activities for the next few months.
system: I believe you need rest for now. You have much more time to join school activities after this.
user: But I need to get well soon as I got a football competition next month. I cannot give up on that.
system: Maybe you should take more rest and follow the instructions from the doctor.
user: For sure I will do that. I am going there now.
system: Hopefully, you will be cured soon. Good luck with your competition.
