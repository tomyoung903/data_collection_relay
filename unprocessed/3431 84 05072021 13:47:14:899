user: Yesterday, David and I hit up the hottest bars back in Swoony Street. 
system: That sounds like a really good time! 
user: So I was thinking to find another place to hangout next weekend as well. 
system: Sure thing! Did you enjoy the music or the drinks more? 
user: Actually Dave and I were really into the acts playing at the bars. Maybe we could try a nightclub this time to dance the night away. 
system: Well, you guys do know how to have a good time. Do you already know which one you want to visit?
