user: Dude can I just say that I have almost zero knowledge of history in Europe. 
system: Well that is unfortunate but I am sure it is something you can live with. 
user: Yes but I saw a youtube video today and I was really intrigued, especially about the Roman history, the Crusaders and everything. 
system: Ah so your inner secret historian just woke up aye! 
user: Hahaha that's pretty cute. Now I am thinking of expanding my knowledge by heading to a museum or something. 
system: I mean why not, life is all about learning and becoming better!
