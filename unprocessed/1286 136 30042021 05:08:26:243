user: I have Asian friends visiting from out of town. Do you think they will enjoy Italian or Indian food more?
system: I think they may be more familiar with the taste of Indian food since it's more similar to Asian food.
user: You may be right. But I hope we can try out both.
system: Maybe you can try out da vinci pizzaria for lunch and royal spice for dinner?
user: That is a good idea! It is their first time visiting and I hope they will enjoy their stay.
system: I'm sure they will!
