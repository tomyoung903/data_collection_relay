user: k, thanks. Is the museum gonna be far? I don't want to tire out my elderly parents and kids too much.
system: Blimey! That's the best part. It's so near you can actually walk from the hotel.
user: Hm, ok. That's about it. 
system: Be prepared to be gobsmacked by the awesome sceneries during your walk! Stay safe.
