user: My credit card information was stolen last week. 
system: Oh no, I hope you did not lose anything. 
user: Someone used it at a place called Nusha at least 30 times. 
system: Have you managed to catch the person who used your card? 
user: Unfortunately not. But Nusha must be an amazing place if that guy went there 30 times so I think I might see it for myself. 
system: Some relaxation sounds good after such an ordeal.
