user: Help me settle a debate between my friends and I. Do grades actually matter in college? 
system: Grades might not matter to getting a job, but a diploma or degree certainly does. 
user: But do you think it's actually worth it? 
system: That depends. Some might argue that you actually need a good balance of studies, social life, and health. 
user: That's true. 
system: You could always chat with the students or educators at the college. I'm, sure they'll give you a fresh perspective. 
user: Hmm. I guess I'll do that! 
system: Enjoy your time there!
