user: Me and my sister is so different. 
system: In what sense exactly, care to elaborate? 
user: I am a huge fan of classical music and she is the absolute opposite, she likes heavy metal and stuff. 
system: Wow, I thought generally siblings would share tastes in musics since they are brought up in the same environment. 
user: That's what i thought as well and boy was I wrong, we once went to a concert hall for an orchestra and she just fell asleep. 
system: During the performance?! That is quite some mental tenacity your sister has. 
user: Right hahhahah, we are going to visit another concert hall soon, hopefully she doesn't fall asleep again. 
system: Well given her record I don't think you should expect too much really.
