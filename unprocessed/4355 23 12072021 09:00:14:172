user: I have to leave town for some bloody company lunch.  
system: I’m sure it’ll be over before you know it.  
user: What’s worse is that my company isn’t even cover my whole trip to the lunch place! 
system: Really? 
user: Yeah they’re only covering my train ticket there! They’re expecting me to pay for the remaining travel costs out of pocket! 
system: That’s a real shame.  
user: Ugh. At least the restaurant isn’t too far from Ely Train Station so it won’t be too expensive.  
system: That’s good to hear.
