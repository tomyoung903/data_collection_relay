system: It's really easy to get burn out when you're constantly on the road.
user: Yeah, you know what?! I've another conference to attend this Saturday.
system: That sounds awful.
user: Yeah, you're right it does! Thankfully I've got my leave approved for the year end.
system: Sounds fun! You seem sorely in need of a break.
