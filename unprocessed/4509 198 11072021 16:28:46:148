user: One second. Would it be weird for white people to eat Hakka food? 
system: No, why would it be weird? 
user: I don't know, cultural appropriation or something. 
system: That does not make sense to me. Everyone loves Chinese food.  
user: I guess. 
system: Especially ones that are higher-priced, if you know what I mean. 
user: I see what you did there. 
system: Well, North is an amazing place to be, so please do enjoy!
