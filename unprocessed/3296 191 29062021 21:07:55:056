user: Alright. Now can you find me some friends? Haha I'm just kidding.  
system: Don't be so hard on yourself, everyone finds friends eventually.  
user: Oh no I am not that desperate yet, I just moved here and have yet to socialize. 
system: Perhaps a bar would be better suited to making friends than eating alone.  
user: That sounds like an idea for another time. I will just take my alone time for now. 
system: Alright, I wish you all the best.
