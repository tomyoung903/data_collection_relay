user: Our family wants to watch a movie together but we don't prefer to watch with other people. 
system: You can stream the movie at the guesthouse through the television. There will be no one else except your family watching the movie! 
user: That is a great idea! We can do it at night after a long day out. 
system: I recommend a horror movie if all of you are into it! 
user: We are not really a fan of horror movie, we prefer comedy movie instead. 
system: That's fantastic. I suggest that you can make or buy some popcorn such that all of you can enjoy the movie with some food too!
