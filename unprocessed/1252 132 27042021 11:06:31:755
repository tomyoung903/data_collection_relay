user: Yes. My little one fell down and I think might have broken his arm.
system: Oh dear, that sounds serious. Would you like me to help contact someone you're close to as well?
user: Yes, can you please message my son's father and let him know. We're divorced but he should know about his son.
system: Sure thing. I'm sorry to hear that though.
user: Don't be. I'm glad that we're no longer married. It was a pain in the neck.
system: Well I'm not surprised. Marriages don't always work out. I hope your son recovers soon though.
