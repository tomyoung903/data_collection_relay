user: Nothing for now. My grandma had a pretty nasty fall. 
system: Oh no. Is she alright? 
user: She's conscious, but I can tell she is in pain. 
system: What happened, how did she fall? 
user: No idea. I just heard her shout and we all rushed to her room to find her on the floor. She was sleeping before. 
system: Do you think she fell off her bed? 
user: Maybe not, her cane isn't on the side of her bed, but instead on the floor with her. 
system: Maybe she tried getting up? 
user: I think she woke up from her nap and went to stand but something happened and she fell.  
system: Get her thoroughly checked at the hospital.
