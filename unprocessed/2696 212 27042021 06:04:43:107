user: Wow! That sounds convenient, what if I am not able to get a ride through the app?
system: There are multiple cab companies for you to hire a ride! I am able to search and get back to you if you would like.
user: It is alright, I should be able to get a few off Google. Thank you! Hopefully, it will not start raining when I'm going around town.
system: It is my pleasure. I am sure there will be nice places for you to sit and wait until the rain stops if you do not want to call a cab. I shall wish for dry and wonderful weather when you are out on your trip!
