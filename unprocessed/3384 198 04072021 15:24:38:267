user: Is all saints church a good place for kids? 
system: Of course. Are you going with your family? 
user: Yes, my wife and my children. We're on a vacation. 
system: That sounds amazing. How old are your 3 children? 
user: Firstborn is 13, middle child is 10 and the youngest is 6. 
system: That sounds great. It will be an exciting and memorable trip for them. 
user: Yes, I hope so. Sadly, we can only stay for 2 days. 
system: Oh, why is that? Is it because of the tight budget? 
user: Yes. Other than that, my wife and I will need to get back to work on the third day. 
system: That's unfortunate. But look at the bright side! You can spend 2 nights with your family. That is always better than none! 
user: I suppose you're right. It is pretty great. 
system: Enjoy your vacation!
