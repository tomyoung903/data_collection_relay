user: It's alright. I'm entertaining some Chinese investors for my new startup. 
system: Interesting. What is your startup about? 
user: It's an advanced machine learning app for social media. 
system: Oh alright. What does it do? 
user: Every time a user clicks a photo, if the user wishes to do so, the photo is posted on all of the user's social media accounts. 
system: Where does the machine learning aspect come into this? 
user: The app learns user habits as well as posting style and format. It then performs real-time changes to the image as well any captions or tags to maximise exposure and views. 
system: Oh damn. So it's like a cheat code of sorts to get more popular? 
user: Hahaha, you could put it that way. But not just for personal use. A company could launch a new product using this platform. A government could inform people about any significant updates. 
system: So it's quite scalable. The Chinese investors, are they interested in your platform? 
user: They have shown some interest, but they really want to see it firsthand. I need to impress them, not just with my application, but in other ways as well. 
system: I see. I'm sure they will enjoy the cuisine at lang hong. Food is the best way to get someone to listen.
