user: aren't you going to ask me why I requested for a hotel that doesn't charge for parking? 
system: now that you mentioned it, i'm curious. 
user: my boyfriend is coming over to the hotel later in the day to hang out and he will be driving. 
system: why don't he pick you from the college though? is it because it's too early? 
user: that's right! he can't wake up early even if his life depended on it haha 
system: you know him so well, it's cute. well, enjoy your stay at carolina then!
