user: Emily just invited me to dinner this week. 
system: Oh, will you be going?
user: Yes. Work is not so hectic for once. 
system: That's nice. It's a great opportunity to catch up with old friends.
user: Yes, I haven't seen her for almost a year. We'll be meeting in Cambridge for the dinner. Unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with the area.
system: I'm happy to help. Please let me know what you need.
