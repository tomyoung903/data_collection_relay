user: Actually, I am doing the challenge of going on a trip without spending any penny. 
system: That's sounds interesting! Maybe you can try to contact the hotel. You can ask them whether you can work for them and in exchange offer you a staycation there. 
user: I have tried to contact several. But none of them are willing to do so. 
system: Maybe can ask some place like Airbnb? 
user: I never try that before. I will take this into consideration. 
system: I hope your challenge will be successful!
