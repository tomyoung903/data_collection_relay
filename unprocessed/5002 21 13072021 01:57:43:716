user: I keep getting beaten by my friend in Tennis, it is frustrating. 
system: Its only a game, maybe you might be able to enjoy it more if you concern yourself less with losing. 
user: It feels good to be better at people in things. 
system: There will always be people that are better than you though, and even if you are better than your friend, it doesn't do much for you other than a feel good feeling that doesn't last. 
user: I hate to admit that it is a good point. On to other things, I have to travel to Cambridge in two days to check on one of my company's branches. 
system: I hope the company branch is doing fine.
