user: I just had a class reunion, after so many years, everyone changed so much. 
system: Aww, I am sure it is really nice to see your classmates again. 
user: Yes but its really sad as well, everyone aged so much, I can really feel the passing of time. 
system: Don't be too beat up about it, we will have to accept this as a part of life. 
user: I know, and coming back here to Borxbourne also brings back many fond memories haha. 
system: Did things change a lot?
