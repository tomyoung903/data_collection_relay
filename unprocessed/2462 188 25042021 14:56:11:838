user: That makes sense. Downtown areas have less parking space, aren't they?
system: Yeah, it is actually quite expensive to have the property there.
user: Which one do you think is more convenient for me?
system: It is hard to tell. Both of them have roughly two or three subway stations away from the restaurant you booked.
user: Alright, I guess I will go with the second.
system: Perfect! We will reserve the room for you and hope you have an amazing day there!
