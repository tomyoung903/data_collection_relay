user: I'm bringing my family on a trip. It's tiring to take care of 4 young children and 2 elderly at the same time though. 
system: You have a big family. Will the children and elderly be fine on the train? It is a very long ride after all.  
user: That might be an issue. My elderly parents don't have the greatest mobility and my young children cannot sit still. 
system: Maybe you can ask if there are toys to keep your children company? You can ask if there are accessible seats for you parents as well.  
user: That's a good idea! I will ask when we get to the station. 
system: Have fun on your trip! It's good to spend time with your family.
