user: Finally, an extremely funny restaurant is opening again. 
system: Why is the restaurant funny? 
user: They sell the best summer food but closes every summer for renovations. 
system: That sounds contradictory. But I believe one can enjoy good food whenever. 
user: The place is called Midsummer House Restaurant, can't wait to dine there again. I just really wish they will actually open in a correct time next time. 
system: The food must be good if it keeps you this excited.
