user: I would say that I am an art person.
system: I suggest that you bring a set of color pencils and a coloring book to keep you occupied. Coloring isn’t just for children, it can be a tranquil experience and help you with relaxation as you allow your creative juice to flows. Otherwise, I would suggest you take a sketchbook and sketch the sceneries that your train passes by. 
user: But I am not confident of my drawing skills...
system: You can always try to sketch with a pencil and paper, you will be surprised by what you can draw!
