user: Tonight's dinner was something of a failure. 
system: Why, what happened? 
user: Well, we were making Spanish chicken kebabs because we wanted to try some Spanish food. 
system: And? 
user: They burnt in the oven because we forgot about them. 
system: That's unfortunate. Didn't you use a timer? 
user: We did, but we wanted a bit more char, then we overdid it. Either way, I hope to try some Spanish food soon. 
system: Don't let the failure get in your way. You can do better next time!
