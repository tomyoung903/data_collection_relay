user: This is my first family holiday in a while. I'm hoping that everyone will enjoy themselves. 
system: I think they will. Home from home is a family-friendly hotel. While you are at it, you can look into some activities to do too.
user: You are right. I should probably start looking up on some things to do, one that can involve both my parents and my two children.
system: That sounds great. What do you have in mind?
user: Maybe a trip to the nearby zoo? I've read good reviews about it.
system: The zoo sounds fantastic! I think people of all ages can enjoy their time there. Hope it goes as planned!
