user: My sister just bought me a beautiful painting. I love art. 
system: What kind of art do you like? 
user: Oh, I'm not an expert, I just like to stand around in museums and pretend I understand the paintings.
system: That's funny. Actually, a lot of people do that, too. 
user: I wish there were more museums where I live. 
system: Me too. More art is always a good thing. If you ever move to the east, I'll have a few to recommend to you.
