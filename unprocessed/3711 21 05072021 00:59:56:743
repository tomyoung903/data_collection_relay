user: I just found out that the original author for the cartoon Spongebob Squarepants has passed away. 
system: Oh dear. The cartoon had a very big influence on a generation of children and their families. It is tragic to see him go.  
user: It is indeed tragic. Anyways I had a good time with my friends here at Broxbourne for our semester break and it is time for us to return. 
system: I hope you had a good rest.
