user: My sister's celebrating her birthday on Tuesday but I have work that day. Should I go?
system: Well, she's your sister!
user: I guess you're right, I should probably go down. It's her 30th anyway. Either way, I've Wednesday off too so I can spend some time in Cambridge too.
system: That's the spirit!
