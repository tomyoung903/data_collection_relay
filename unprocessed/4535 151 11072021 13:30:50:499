user: Not for now. I'm taking my nephews on a trip. 
system: Oh, that's very sweet of you. Any particular occasion? 
user: They just finished their finals. And I have the ability to work whenever I want. 
system: That's nice. What are you guys planning to do? 
user: Well, we are planning to waste some time near their home and then watch a football match. 
system: I see. It's nice that you spend time with your family. 
user: Yeah. But I have a work meeting later too. Although I can work whenever I want, clients don't. So I need to get back to work on time. 
system: Don't worry. You'll reach King's in time.
