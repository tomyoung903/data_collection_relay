user: I’m meeting some old college friends this weekend! 
system: That’s great! What do you have planned? 
user: We’re gonna wonder around Cambridge and hang out! But I think I’ll probably be late to the gathering.  
system: Sounds fun! Why would you be late though! 
user: I have to drop by Birmingham New Street office for some work stuff, what a pain.  
system: That’s too bad, but at least you’ll get to have some fun once you’re done!
