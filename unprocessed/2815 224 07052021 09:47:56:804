user: Wait. Is there walk-in booking for the guest house? I don't want to go there and have nowhere to stay in. Ugh. It'll be so annoying to find another place.
system: I know right? Anyway, nope, strictly no walk-ins. If you want to save yourself the hassle, I can just book them for you. I mean, it's free and will make your life easier.
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
