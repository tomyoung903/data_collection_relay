user: What would I do without you? I wonder if I will be spending a lot of money on the day itself. 
system: I guess not. After all, you do not have to pay to enter the church. 
user: That's true. 
system: That is, unless you decide to splurge on your noodles, although I suppose there is a limit as to how much a person can eat. 
user: I agree. I probably won't be spending so much on my meals anyway. 
system: Well, that sounds great then!
