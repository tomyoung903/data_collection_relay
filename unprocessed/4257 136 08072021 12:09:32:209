user: My grandmother is coming all the way from India. I really must impress her! 
system: The restaurant should definitely impress her! The food should be very good. 
user: I hope she likes the Marriott too. 
system: I'm sure she will. No one will complain about having free wi-fi after all! 
user: You're right! I hope the wi-fi isn't slow though. That will annoy anyone. 
system: Don't worry too much and just have fun with your family!
