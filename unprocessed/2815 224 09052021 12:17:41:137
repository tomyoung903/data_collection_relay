user: Why do you keep asking if I need you to book the hotel when I clearly ignored it from the get-go?
system: Well, their policy is strictly no walk-ins. But! You can just send me the info and you're good to go. Easy, right?
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I'll think about it. I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
