user: Nope. This will be my first time. I believe it will be nice. 
system: Of course. Indian food is so delicious and absolutely worth to try. 
user: Sounds great! Do you think there will be seats available during dinner time? 
system: Good question. But I believe it wouldn't be crowded. Because by common sense, people usually intend to have their dinner in the downtown, instead of near the college. 
user: Understood, thank you for your analysis. You are so smart. 
system: Alright, enjoy your meal and I am looking forward to hear your feedback of the food there.
