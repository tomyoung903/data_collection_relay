user: My interview is this coming Monday, feeling a little bit nervous honestly. 
system: What kind of interview is it? 
user: It is for an internship at a very prestigious company, and I feel a little ill-prepared. 
system: Well don't be! Interviews are meant to find out if you are a good fit for the role, just be true to yourself and answer everything honestly and as best as you can! 
user: Thank you so much! I really appreciate the advice:) 
system: Yes just relax! With that said preparing is always important, especially if its a technical interview. 
user: I know. I have been reading up a lot on the subject and looking at interview questions, but I still don't think I did enough. 
system: That's what happens to everyone. No one thinks they are ever truly ready for something but still we go for it!
