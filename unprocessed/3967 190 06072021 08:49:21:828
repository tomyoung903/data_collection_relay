user: I feel that we should always try to work on self-improvement. 
system: I agree. I suggest that you might want to listen to podcasts at night in the hotel room when you are resting for the night! You can gain more knowledge even if it's half an hour a day. 
user: That's a great recommendation but I am more of a video learner. 
system: You can give it a try as podcast like videos requires no reading and little energy. The advantage is that it doesn't cause visual strain on the eyes compared to videos! 
user: I can listen to it when I am going out.  
system: That's another benefit of podcast which is that it is very flexible. You can listen to it at anywhere and anytime even when you are exercising!
