user: I took a train from the central station a few weeks ago. It was hell.
system: Oh? What happened?
user: It was so crowded. I got elbowed thrice.
system: That sounds rough. The station can get quite crowded given its location.
user: Precisely. This time, I'll be trying out the Birmingham new street station. It's smaller and kind of out of the way, but it's quite close to my house.
system: I see. Hopefully, it won't be too crowded.
