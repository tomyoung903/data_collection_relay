user: I had an argument with my daughter several days ago over her boyfriend, and then she just got on the train to Cambridge and left. 
system: Oh, is it because there's something you don't like about her boyfriend? 
user: Of course, he was twice divorced and had two kids to raise. My daughter was only eighteen!  
system: You must be so worried about her right now. You know, kids have grown up, and subjective criticism will only make your relationship worse.  
user: Yes, you are right. I need to calm down and have peaceful communication with her and her boyfriend. Emm, tomorrow is Monday, I am leaving as soon as possible! 
system: I am sure this conversation will lead to a good result. May I book your ticket?
