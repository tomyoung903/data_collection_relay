user: Great. I just heard a really big crash over at my neighbour's place.  
system: Oh no. Have you checked? 
user: Not yet. Since last week I have been hearing quite a few arguments and sounds from their home. 
system: I hope they are okay. 
user: Me too. I wonder if they are going through a rough patch in their marriage. It's not always easy. 
system: Yup, marriage definitely isn't. 
user: For the past few hours, the argument really got heated and I heard a few threats. The loud crash and bang a few minutes ago is making me worry. 
system: Don't worry. Get police help.
