user: I'm visiting my cousin because I heard he fell of his bike while speeding downhill at the park near his home. 
system: Is he in the intermediate dependency ward? Is the injury serious?  
user: I'm not too sure. I only heard that he got a concussion because he hit his head and he wasn't wearing a helmet. 
system: That sounds very serious! You have to get to the hospital quickly! 
user: Yes! I'm getting there as fast as I can. 
system: Hope he's doing well and have a speedy recovery!
