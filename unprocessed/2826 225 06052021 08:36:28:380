user: should I bring an umbrella?
system: well it is always good to have an umbrella on hand, but the chance of raining is only 20% for that day, and the journey is mostly sheltered.
user: I want to visit the museum in the afternoon, what's the best time?
system: 3.30pm I would say, it is the time with the least visitors. Also, the museum does not open during the weekends!
user: Thanks for the reminder, or I would have planned a trip during the weekend...
system: no problem!
