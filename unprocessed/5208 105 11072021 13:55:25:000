user: My friend just told me about how he met this really cute girl on the street and they just ended up dating. 
system: Wow congrats to your friend for making it that far, truly courageous. 
user: I am kinda jealous honestly, how do people even do that like just approach someone and talk and eventually date goodness. 
system: Different people have different character, this way of knowing people may not fit you and you have your own style! 
user: That's what I tell myself to feel better as well. But it is really hard to meet people when I am working all the time. 
system: Where do you work? And I am sure it doesn't take up all of your time. 
user: I work at the Golden House, and believe me it does, I am here right now and it is a Saturday. 
system: Damn that really sucks, do your company not have regulations about working on weekends or anything.
