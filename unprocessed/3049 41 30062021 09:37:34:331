user: I've recently come across this rock band called Black Veil Brides and I fell in love with their songs. 
system: I'm not a fan of theirs, but I've heard that their live concerts are amazing. 
user: Yeah, from the videos that I've seen, they really know how to get the crowd going. 
system: Perhaps you should go to one if they ever drop by here. 
user: Believe it or not, they're actually having a concert in Cambridge in two days! So glad that I managed to snatch a ticket. 
system: Wow, that's perfect timing. Hope you have a blast!
