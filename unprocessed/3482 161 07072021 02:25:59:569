user: God it looks like I can never get away from taking taxis, especially when I don't own a car. 
system: That's true. Ride hailing is definitely a convenience that you can't miss out on. 
user: I read somewhere that taking taxi is actually cheaper than owning a car, taking into account the maintenance costs, fuel and other things. 
system: That sounds pretty convincing, but there does come a time when you can't find a ride. Especially when you are away from home, travelling between restaurants and hotels on a tight schedule. 
user: Right. It's also unlikely that I would be able to bring along a car on my business trip. 
system: That really gives much to think about. I hope this trip is a comfortable one for you.
