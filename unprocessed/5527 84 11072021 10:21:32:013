user: I'm taking my friend to eat at a Singaporean restaurant this weekend. 
system: Why? 
user: He hasn't tried any Asian food aside from chow mein! Not even sushi or teriyaki. 
system: Maybe he is someone who likes to keep things the same. 
user: Yes, he does! He wears the same shirts every week, and his lunch is basically on a weekly rotation basis. It's almost infuriating. 
system: He sounds like a robot, following his programming. Haha. 
user: In any case, it is time for him to experience Singaporean food. 
system: Yes, Mr Gourmet. Expose your friends to your home cuisine.
