user: Hi! Are you free now? 
system: Of course! I'm always free to help out. 
user: Great. I am moving but I'm so confused with all the options I have. 
system: Don't worry. What are you deciding between? 
user: I have a few transport options to move everything from where I'm currently living to Cambridge, where I'll be moving to. But I don't know which is the best! 
system: I see. Don't worry, we can go through this together. What are your plans so far?
