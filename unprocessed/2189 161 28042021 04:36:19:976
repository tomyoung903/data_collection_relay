user: I feel like finding a good hotel to stay at an affordable price is difficult nowadays.
system: Well you did mention that you were fine with the expensive price range.
user: I know. I'm only willing to spend this much because my family hasn't been on a vacation for so long and I want them to have a good time.
system: I'm sure your family would appreciate it. Maybe you could find some activities to do together as a family during your stay.
user: Yeah that's a good idea. Thanks for the suggestion!
system: Great! Hope you guys enjoy yourselves.
