user: My aunt from China will be visiting. She's vegetarian so I hope the restaurant has vegetarian options. 
system: I see. Since there are no vegetarian restaurants, an asian restaurant is the next best option. 
user: Yes. It's difficult to find vegetarian food nowadays. 
system: I'm sure there will be food at the restaurant that she can eat. 
user: I hope so, otherwise it will be a disaster. 
system: Enjoy yourselves and don't worry too much about the food!
