user: That's great. My wife won't have trouble finding food. Is it also closely to any fast-food chains?
system: Sadly the nearest fast-food chain is 1 km away. Would you like me to find another accommodation ?
user: No, since I'll be only staying for 2 days, I don't think it should be a problem. What is the reservation cancellation policy of the accommodation.
system: You will not be charged for the room if the booking is cancelled 48 hours prior to intended stay period. Should I proceed to book?
user: Not just yet, let me get back to you on that in sometime. Thanks for the help though.
system: Sure! No problem, Have a great day. Hoping to assist you soon!
