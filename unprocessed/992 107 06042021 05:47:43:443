user: I'm meeting Larry tomorrow. He's an old college buddy.
system: That's nice, it's good to reconnect with old friends.
user: Yes. I met him right before I changed my major to film studies.
system: Really? What did you study before?
user: I tried my hand at architecture. It was actually quite interesting. I would have loved to explore it further but I was no good at art.
system: That's a shame. Perhaps you can reconnect with that part of your life when you meet your friend.
user: That's a good idea. We used to visit architectural attractions and discuss the styles and history. 
system: Should I find some places you could explore?
