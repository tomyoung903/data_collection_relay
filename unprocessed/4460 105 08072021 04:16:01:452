user: Have you seen Harry Potter? 
system: No. Why do you ask? 
user: Well I did, and platform 93/4 really left a deep impression on me. I have always wanted to visit the London Kings Cross since young. 
system: I see, what is so special about it? 
user: It is the platform Harry uses to get to the wizarding world so it is just super iconic haha. I think I could go there this week! 
system: Why not! It will be a childhood dream fulfilled.
