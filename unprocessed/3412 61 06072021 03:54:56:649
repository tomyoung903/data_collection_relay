user: I am planning a proposal for my girlfriend! 
system: That's great! Hope everything will go well! 
user: You know... She is a romantic person. Maybe I should make the proposal in some special places? 
system: As far as I know, many people who have a romantic partner would make the same choice as you.  
user: I remember she said she once had a dream in which she was asked to be a princess on a boat.  
system: That sounds like a very romantic idea. I've heard some humans saying every girl and boy has a princess or prince dream.   
user: Yes, it's time to make her dream come true! On a boat! 
system: That is great. But there is no place to rent a boat around your home.
