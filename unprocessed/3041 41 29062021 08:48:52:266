user: I have been having so much fun at the music festival these past few nights! 
system: Nothing like jamming out with a crowd. 
user: Yeah. But as much as I enjoyed it, it was tiring as well. 
system: Make sure to rest well afterward. 
user: I will. Luckily, I'm currently staying at London Liverpool Street, which is only 5 minutes walk from the festival. 
system: Glad to hear that. Travelling is definitely a real pain when you are tired.
