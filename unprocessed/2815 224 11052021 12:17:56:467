user: What if the wifi is unstable? What do I do?
system: I'm sure it will be alright but you can just reach out to the staff if there's an issue. What's up?
user: It's nothing, I just want to be able to access my socials during the trip and don't want to waste data.
system: If the wifi does go down, maybe it's a sign for a little social detox. Kidding. Enjoy!
