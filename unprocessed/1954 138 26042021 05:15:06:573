user: Hi there. 
system: Hello! How are you?
user: I'm doing good! 
system: That's really nice to hear. How may I help?
user: I'm having a dinner on Saturday but I don't know where to go.
system: Ah, choosing a place to eat is always a tough decision. Perhaps I could provide you with some suggestions? Narrow it down for me.
user: You've been a really great help.
system: That's what I hope to do. 
user: Could I treat you to a drink?
system: Haha, I'm a computer! Any liquid would render me helpless. Thanks though :)
user: Aw man, thanks anyway.
system: No problem!
