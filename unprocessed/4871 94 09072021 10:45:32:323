user: My family is flying in from Japan to visit me this week ! 
system: That's nice ! Have you been separate from them for long ? 
user: I haven't seen them since I moved here for work. We only managed to catch up with weekly phone calls. 
system: Work is important, but so is family. 
user: My family wants to go sight-seeing around the country, so I will need to make a list of places to go. 
system: Maybe you can ask your family for their opinions. 
user: I know my parents love museums. They often mail me souvenirs from museums they visit. 
system: That is very nice of your parents to do so.
