user: My friend Tommy wants to go watch this movie called 'A Big Fish'. 
system: That sounds like an interesting title, what is it about? 
user: I presume it is about a big fish? I don't really know, haven't checked the synopsis.  
system: Do you not care if you are going to watch a good film? 
user: Not really,  I care more about who I am watching with. And we are going on Sunday, so it's just to kill time anyway. 
system: I see! Well hopefully the movie won't be a complete disaster at least.
