user: Alright. Since the indoor gyms are closed I have to go outdoors for my workouts. 
system: I see. But outdoors won't be the same as indoors. 
user: That's true. Sadly no weights or cable machines. But it will be fresh outdoor air. 
system: Unless it is polluted. 
user: Ah. I hope not. Also, I hope it doesn't rain. 
system: That would be terrible. Why are you working out now? 
user: I had made a new year's resolution to be fitter this year. Sadly like most people, I didn't keep up with it. 
system: So now is your time to get back on track. 
user: It is. Got to get that beach body ready. 
system: Enjoy your sports sessions.
