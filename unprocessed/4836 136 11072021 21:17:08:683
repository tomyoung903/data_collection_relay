user: I hope the ride will be comfortable. I have long legs and they get tired if they get cramped up in small places. 
system: You can try to get the front seats of the train. Usually those seats have more leg space. 
user: Maybe I won't even get a train ticket if I can't get those front seats. 
system: Yes, otherwise you will have to deal with 17 minutes of an uncomfortable sitting position. 
user: I hope I don't have to suffer like that.  
system: Good luck! Hope the train ride doesn't affect your trip!
