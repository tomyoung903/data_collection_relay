user: I like to set my own itinerary. I don't have to care about the others. 
system: The museum will be a great opportunity for you to visit as you can go directly to the art pieces you are interested in and not waste time on those you have no desire to see! 
user: I agree. I can move at my own pace too. 
system: I am sure it will be equally fun when visiting museums alone!
