user: My cousin is applying the colleges this year. My sister is pretty anxious to choose her daughter's university. 
system: It is normal, parents worry for their children about everything. 
user: She wishes her daughter to study in ely, so she can be closer to home. 
system: It sounds reasonable. 
user: She asked me for help too. Maybe me visiting colleges in person can help her. 
system: Making a good decision for her child must be important to her.

system: I feel the same.
