user: I think I injured my back during an exercise. It hurts a bit occasionally. 
system: Are you feeling okay? I hope it is nothing severe.  
user: It is just a minor injury, it will recover by itself. 
system: Is anyone taking care of you? 
user: My girlfriend is, she's going a trip with me.  
system: You can ask her to give you a back massage at the Autumn House. You will feel much better. 
user: I hope she is willing to do it!  
system: It will be a very sweet gesture!
