user: I have a report due next week. 
system: Have you started on the report yet? 
user: Unfortunately no. It's very noisy at home and I can't concentrate. 
system: I am sure you will be able to focus on working on your report at the college. You can find a quiet and comfortable place that suits you! 
user: Will it disturb the students there? 
system: I think it will be fine as long as you don't make a lot of noise!
