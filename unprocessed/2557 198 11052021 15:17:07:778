user: I believe I will have a great day. I'm optimistic. 
system: Loving the positivity. Are you going Cambridge with your family? What's the occasion?
user: I am actually going there with a group of friends I met recently in my English Language class. Going there to experience and feel the British culture, and to just have fun, generally speaking. 
system: That sounds nice. Indulging in the British experience by eating British food is the way to go! What are your plans once you reach there?
user: I haven't gotten a plan. Maybe we will just decide once we reach. 
system: I totally admire that attitude. Everyone needs a carefree holiday every once in a while!
