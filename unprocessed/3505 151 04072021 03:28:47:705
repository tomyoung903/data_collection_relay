user: I'm taking my extended family to visit my grandparents. 
system: That's great. Family is important. 
user: Yeap. But it's not a social call. Both my grandparents were admitted to the hospital. 
system: Oh no. What happened? 
user: They both had some fever these past few days. My parents asked them to go get it checked. Turns out they both have Covid. 
system: That's terrible. How are they doing right now? 
user: They are hanging on. Both of them have at least taken one dose of the vaccine, so I'm hoping they'll be fine. 
system: I hope so too. 
user: Anyways, as soon as we arrive, my wife and I will be heading to the hospital. Due to Covid restrictions, not all of us can are allowed to enter. I'll have to keep my kids occupied. 
system: I'm sure the kids are worried too. In that case, they can distract themselves by watching Netflix on the free wifi.
