user: I think the most important thing in a hotel is actually the toilet. 
system: What? Not the service staff, the room or whatever but the toilet? 
user: Absolutely, honestly I am okay with lousy things but except the toilet, it is the one thing I cannot tolerate. 
system: Wow you have really strange standards, so if you were to choose between everything good but toilet bad you'd choose the other way round? 
user: I mean I have been staying at A and B Guest House, their toilet is great althought they are not too good at everything else, and I really liked it. 
system: Wow you sound like you don't sleep in your room but rather in the toilet.
