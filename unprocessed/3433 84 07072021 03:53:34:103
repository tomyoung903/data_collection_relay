user: Do you think that we spend too much money on Mother's Day? 
system: We do tend to spend a lot of money on Mother's Day, but that doesn't mean that is all there is to it. 
user: Then is there more? 
system: I'd like to think that Mother's Day is the day to honour the love and sacrifices that moms around the world have been giving to their children for millenia. 
user: Haha, that was just a random thought. Either way, Mother's Day is next Wednesday. I've already booked a flight from Stansted airport to visit my family. 
system: Yes, you still have time to get your mom a gift.
