user: It's been such a wild few days for me. 
system: What makes you say that? 
user: I somehow bumped into my old friends, and we spent the last few days talking about nostalgic memories and our current lives. 
system: Coincidences like this never cease to amaze me. 
user: Me too, though maybe it wasn't a pure coincidence. We all grew up together in cambridge, so it just makes sense that I'll meet them here again. 
system: How interesting, I'm sure you had a lot to talk about with them.
