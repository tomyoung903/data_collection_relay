user: I was playing Among Us with my friends yesterday.
system: That's nice, it is a very popular game.
user: Sadly I won't be able to play again this week, I'm leaving Cambridge for a meeting with an important client.
system: Client meetings are important, I'm sure you can play next time. Is there anything I can help you with?
