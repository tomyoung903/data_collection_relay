user: I am bringing my younger brother and sister to visit their new school there. 
system: Maybe you can prepare some scripts for explanation to them during the journey to that place. Besides that maybe you can plan some activities for them during the staycation there! 
user: Yeah, I will do so. I hope that they can adapt themselves to the environment there. 
system: The environment will force them to adapt themselves there. 
user: I just hope that it would be too hard for them during this process. 
system: There will be mentors in the school there who are willing to help them. Don't worry too much.
