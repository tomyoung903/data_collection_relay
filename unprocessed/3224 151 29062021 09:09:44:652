user: Thank you. I'm taking a few of my friends for a tour around the London region. They have never visited London before 
system: Sounds great. What places are you planning to show them? 
user: They want to visit the usual museums and check out the Tower of London as well as the Eye.  
system: Sounds like quite a plan. 
user: Yup. We plan to go cafe hopping around. I'll be taking them to the numerous great restaurants and bars along the way. 
system: Good thing then that you guys have a comfortable guesthouse to rest and recuperate at.
