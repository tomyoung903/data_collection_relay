user: I just hope this whole thing is a good decision.
system: Fingers crossed. I'm sure you'll have the best time there. Wednesday will be your day!
user: I do hope so. I will be bringing my friends along as a surprise trip and I'm worried that they won't enjoy it.
system: No worries, I'm sure all three of you will have a great time there. As the saying goes, "there's never a dull moment with friends". Also, who doesn't love surprises, am I right?
user: Yes, I guess you're right. I am, after all, pretty hyped for the stay!
system: I am really excited for you too! I hope you and your friends will have an amazing time during your one night there.
