user: It's okay. I just finished my work so I'm looking to treat myself. 
system: Finished a big project? 
user: No haha. Today is my cheat day. I've been going to the gym lately. 
system: That's good. A healthy body gives a healthy mind. 
user: Yeah. Recently I came across this diet hack where you eat healthily for most of the week and on one day you cheat. 
system: Meaning? 
user: Meaning, that I can eat whatever I want, no holds barred.  
system: Interesting. However, won't eating whatever you want cause you to lose any gym progress? 
user: That's what I thought at first. But it doesn't, especially if you only cheat on one meal, instead of an entire day. Taking protein powder is also quite important, but damn its expensive. 
system: Good thing your cheat meal is cheap then.
