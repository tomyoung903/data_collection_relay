user: My friend has been urging me to go to nightclubs. 
system: That's odd, why is he so interested in getting you to go? 
user: I don't know, he is just really insistent that I should give it a try. 
system: Do you wish to then? Don't do it if you don't want to. 
user: I guess I don't really mind? But I don't know I am not a huge fan of noisy places. 
system: Well I guess its not wrong to try it at least once in your life.
