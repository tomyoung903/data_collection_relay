user: I hope this place will be nice. 
system: No worries. What's the occasion? Are you going with friends or family? 
user: I'm going with my friends. It's just a small get-together for us to hang out and visit places in the east side that we've never been before. 
system: Oh, where are you all currently living? West? 
user: Yes. They always complain about the distance. 
system: Why would they complain? If anything it would be an exciting adventure together! Worst case scenario, you can always rely on the wifi access. 
user: You're right. Maybe I am paranoid. I do have anxious tendencies. 
system: Well, there's nothing to worry about. I got your back.
