user: I took a train from the central station a few weeks ago. It was hell. I'll try a new one next time.
system: Oh? Which one will you try?
user: Central was so crowded. Birmingham new street.
system: Oh. That's a smaller station.
user: Yes. It's quite close to my house too.
system: I see. Hopefully, it won't be too crowded.
