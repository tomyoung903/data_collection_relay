user: My cousin's birthday is coming up soon and I had to really dig up that restaurant because she was craving a certain type of food that that restaurant serves. 
system: You are very nice to do so. I think she will really enjoy herself. 
user: She will, but the train ride is a problem. She's claustrophobic. 
system: Then she won't do well with small train compartments? 
user: Yes. I'm worried. 
system: Don't worry! I'm sure the train has compartments that a larger to help those who are claustrophobic.
