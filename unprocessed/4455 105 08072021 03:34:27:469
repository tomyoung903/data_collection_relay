user: The people here in Norwich is a lot more pleasant than those I have met in other places. 
system: Why do you say that? I mean you don't have to put others down like that. 
user: Well because it is really like that. They are amicable, welcoming and warm. 
system: And what about people you have met elsewhere? 
user: They are usually much colder, and often too busy minding their own business to even talk to you. 
system: Well I can't change your mind but I don't think sweeping statements generally are true.
