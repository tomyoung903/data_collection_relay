user: Tom just asked me to go fishing with him in Cambridge, I think it's gonna be fun. 
system: Why is he so specific about the location. 
user: I don't know. But I am suspecting that he wants to confess to me there. 
system: Haha, and how do you know that? 
user: That is where we first met, and in our conversation he was dropping subtle hints. 
system: Are you going to say yes then?
