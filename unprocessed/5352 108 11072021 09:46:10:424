user: I had a dream about diving, but I don't even know how to swim. 
system: In my opinion, dreams can be very random at times. 
user: I believe so too. But it did inspire me greatly to learn how to swim. 
system: Learning something new sounds fun! Maybe I should pick up a new skill too. 
user: My friend told me the nearest pool to me is called Abbey Pool and Astroturf Pitch. I'm thinking if it's near and convenient enough, maybe I can train frequently enough to win an olympic athlete! 
system: It will be a lot of hard work and determination but beating an athlete is possible!
