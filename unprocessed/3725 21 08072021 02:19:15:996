user: I have been spending my free time trying out this free game called Dwarf Fortress 
system: Sounds fun! 
user: Yep, it is about managing a group of dwarves to mine out and build a home, while defending yourself from invaders along the way. The author has made his game quite complex in its simulation too. 
system: He must have spent quite a bit of time programming the game. 
user: Anyways, I have to return home soon, my work assignment at London Liverpool Street has completed. 
system: That's great!
