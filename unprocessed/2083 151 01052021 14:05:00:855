user: My wife and I have our 20th anniversary coming up. I am wondering what I should do this time?
system: Well what have you not done the previous 19 times, you can just do the 20th time.
user: Hahaha. What should I do about the kids?
system: I'm sure they will appreciate room service and the opportunity to watch as much Netflix with the free wifi
user: What do you think about gifting my wife some jewellery? I know my wife loves jewellery.
system: Apparently, platinum is highly recommended for the 20th anniversary. There are a few dedicated stores in the Cambridge area. Do you want me to look them up?
user: No, thank you. That will be all for now.
system: Thank you for contacting me. Have a great day!
