user: Cambridge is a really suitable city for living for me, but my friend seem to think otherwise 
system: Could you share what the two of you's views were. 
user: I am absolutely for living in Cambridge, great food, great people and basically solid package for living. 
system: And you friend thought it was a bad idea? 
user: Yeah he finds it to be too happening so it is really not suited for his taste. 
system: Well that is a fair argument, I'd say that at the end of the day it is still up to the type of person you are.
