user: I hope it will be sunny when we get there. It's been a while since we last went to swim. 
system: I would suggest putting on some sunblock before going to the pool. 
user: Thanks for reminding me! My friend gets sunburnt easily. 
system: That's no good! Sunburns hurt a lot. Do make sure you get waterproof sunblock so the pool water don't wash it off so easily. 
user: That's a great idea. I will go buy it now. 
system: Have fun and don't drown.
