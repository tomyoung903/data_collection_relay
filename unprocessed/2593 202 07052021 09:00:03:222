user: Can you remind me of anything to note for the trips?
system: It will be rainy these few days. I would suggest you bring along an umbrella or a raincoat.
user: That reminds me that I haven't gotten raincoats for the kids. Can you set a reminder for tomorrow morning to get the raincoats?
system: I have set the reminder at 08:00 in the morning. Would this timing be appropriate?
