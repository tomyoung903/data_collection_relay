user: You too. I'll be travelling with my kids. I hope they like Cambridge.
system: I think they will. What are the ages of your children?
user: I'm travelling with 4 kids. They are between 6 and 16.
system: Oh, then they might love to see the museums or universities.

system: Not to worry, there is free wifi and interactive games at these places. Your son would have a blast!
