user: My sister's celebrating her birthday on Tuesday but I have work that day. Should I go?
system: Well, she's your sister!
user: It's her 30th but she's celebrating it all the way in Cambridge. That's really far though.
system: She only has one 30th birthday!
user: I guess you're right, I should probably go down. Either way, I've Wednesday off too.
system: That's the spirit! Will you be spending Wednesday there too?
user: Yeah, I'm thinking of getting Alan to come along too.
system: That sounds fun!
