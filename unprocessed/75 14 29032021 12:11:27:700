user: I'm feeling a bit sad that I'll be leaving soon. Monday's only in a few days. 
system: You must have made a lot of good memories here and grown attached to the place. 
user: You bet. It's scary to leave somewhere you've already gotten used to.
system: Always. But you can always find new adventure and make new memories in a new place.
user: That's true. Thanks. That makes me feel a little better. Now if I could just get a train to start my journey... 
system: That's too easy. I'll help you get started on your adventure. Where to?
