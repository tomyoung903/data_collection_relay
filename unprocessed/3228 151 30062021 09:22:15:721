user: It's alright. My wife and I are finally getting to meet our son's Indian girlfriend and her family. 
system: That's really great. How long have they been dating? 
user: It's been just over a year. We have met her before but never her family. He's quite nervous. 
system: The first time is always difficult. 
user: Yeah definitely. I remember the first time I met my wife's parents and introduced my family to them. I had nervous sweats the entire time. 
system: I gather it went well. 
user: Now I am happily married. It's my son's turn now. My dad helped me set up my meeting. I am hoping I did enough for my son. 
system: That's very sweet. I'm sure your son's girlfriend's family will appreciate the tandoori cuisine at the restaurant.
