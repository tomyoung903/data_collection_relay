user: I am not used to travelling alone but I had to as my friends and family are all occupied with something 
system: Dining alone might not necessarily be a bad thing! You can take your time to taste and enjoy the food at the restaurant! 
user: Why is that so? 
system: When you are dining with other people, you might be preoccupied with the conversation but if you are alone, you can just be focused on the food you are eating! 
user: Ohh I see. This means that I won’t be distracted easily.  
system: You sure won’t. You can have a good sensory experience with the food!
