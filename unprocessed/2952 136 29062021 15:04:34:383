user: I'm enrolling in college soon. Hopefully I can get into a central one so that I can stay closer to my grandmother.  
system: Are you going to scout the colleges around that area? 
user: Yes! The free entrance is great since I'm a broke student haha. 
system: That's great! You can visit your grandmother while you are there as well. Maybe bring her along with you to tour the college? 
user: I should. She should go out more often for exercise. 
system: Have a great stay!
