user: I don't have any kids of my own, so my sister just asked me to take care of her daughter for her. 
system: Are you keen on it? Not everyone can stand children as far as I know. 
user: I am okay, I have met her a few times before, really lovely little girl and really bright as well! 
system: I see! That probably makes things a lot easier. How long are you taking care of her for? 
user: Just a few days, but I am currently planning out the schedule to see where I can take her. 
system: Do you have any ideas in mind currently or are you still brainstorming? 
user: I think I will take her to a college, to see how grand and nice it is and hopefully motivate her a little as well. 
system: Sounds great! She will certainly be inspired to attend one in the future if it leaves a good impression.
