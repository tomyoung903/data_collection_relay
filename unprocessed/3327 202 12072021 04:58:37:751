user: Thank you. I'm not sure whether my friends will like Chinese food. 
system: If they have not tried it before, it should be an interesting experience.  
user: I hope you are right. Well, it's just a meal. 
system: Have they tried Cuban food before? 
user: We had Cuban food the last time we went on a trip together and enjoyed it, so we wanted to have some Cuban food this time. 
system: I see, what a pity. But I believe the Chinese food won't be bad as well. 
user: I will know about it soon enough anyway. Thanks for helping. 
system: Have a smooth trip!
