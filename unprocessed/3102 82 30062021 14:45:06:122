user: Hey! I recently started a dance club in my school and I am so excited about it. 
system: Wow! How is it going? 
user: I already have 7 members but we barely know each other. 
system: I guess that can be fixed when you spend more time together. 
user: Maybe we should go somewhere away from cambridge together for some bonding time. 
system: Sounds like a great plan!
