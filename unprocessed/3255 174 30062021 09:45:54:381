user: The travel time is just slightly over an hour. I thought I could watch both my movie and read a book on the journey! What do you suggest that I do? 
system: You should choose the one that you prefer doing more to make the most of your commute! If you're tied for choices, you may look out the window if you happen to take the window seat - it's an amazing experience nonetheless.
