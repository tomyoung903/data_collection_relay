user: There are some pretty good live streamers on twitch.
system: Who do you like watching?
user: I like to watch Vinny Vinesauce. I enjoy his humor and the games that he plays for his viewers.
system: Do you watch the other live streamers that are part of the group that Vinny Vinesauce is in.
user: No, their content doesn't interest me as much as Vinny's. Anyways, I will be going to enjoy my graduation from university with a bunch of friends. This place in Cambridge is far too boring for my taste.
system: Sounds exciting. You will be entering a new stage of your life now that you have finished university.
