user: Hello! I have got a paper for school due soon and would have to do some street research... 
system: Oh, you sound vexed. What kind of paper is it? 
user: It's for history. It's group work, and I'm doing it together with a few friends.  
system: Seems like you got it all planned out! 
user: We all have a free day on Thursday hopefully we can complete the street research by then. 
system: I wish you all the best in your research.
