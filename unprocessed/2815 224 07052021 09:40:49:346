user: wait. Can I do a walk-in booking for acorn guest house or must I book rooms beforehand? I don't want to go there and have no rooms to stay in.
system: Sorry, but there are strictly no walk-ins. It is highly advisable that you book the rooms asap if not, you might be disappointed. Would you like me to book them for you? It's free anyway. 
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Looking forward to your update. Hope to hear from you soon! I'm here to help you anytime you need.
