user: I'll be seeing my friend face-to-face for the first time in a while. 
system: I see, what's the occasion? 
user: He'll be flying over here for a short business trip, so we're thinking that this is a good opportunity to catch up. 
system: That's nice, where will you be meeting him? 
user: I'll be seeing him at Stansted airport, which is really appropriate since that's where I last saw him too.
