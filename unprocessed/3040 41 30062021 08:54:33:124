user: My girlfriend has been bugging me to meet her parents. 
system: You must be nervous. It's always stressful when you have to make good first impressions. 
user: Indeed, but I'm not holding it off because I'm scared, it's because my long-running project doesn't allow me to take time off. 
system: It's hard to escape from work responsibilities, but you should meet them as soon as possible. 
user: Yes, I know. Luckily, the project is now wrapping up and I was able to get time off on Monday. 
system: All the best with your meeting, and don't forget to bring a gift!
