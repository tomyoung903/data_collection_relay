user: Yes please. I would love to learn about something new.
system: That's a great plan. There will be teaching clay modelling in the Arts and Design block from 16:00-18:00 and the auditorium will be hosting a seminar on second price auction theory at 19:00.
user: Wow! That's great. Are these free of charge to outsiders ?
system: The workshop charges outsiders $10 for the supplies, however, the seminar is free of charge for all. Shall I make the reservations?
user: Yes, that would be splendid. Thanks a ton!
system: No problem!
