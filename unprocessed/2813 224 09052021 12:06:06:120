user: Well... actually I'm rather curious if it's gonna be cumbersome to get from the university arms hotel to old schools. What d'ya think?
system: Blimey! That's the best part. It's so near you can actually walk from the hotel.
user: Hm, ok. That's about it. 
system: Be prepared to be gobsmacked by the awesome sceneries during your walk! Stay safe.
