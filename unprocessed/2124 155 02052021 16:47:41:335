user: A movie night sounds great. Should I download some movies on Netflix? I can't decide what to watch though.
system: Would you like me to suggest some movies?
user: I think it's ok for now. I can ask my friends what genre they prefer later.
system: Ok. Don't worry, the free wifi at the lodge is sufficient for you to stream the movies.
user: Alright. That's all I need for now. Thanks!
system: No problem. Have a good holiday.
