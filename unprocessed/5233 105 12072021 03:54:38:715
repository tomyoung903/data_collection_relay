user: My friends were telling me about some ghost stories here in Peterborough. 
system: Really, what kind of stories did they tell? I am curious. 
user: There's one about a headless rider, priest in a cemetery and a ghost roaming the park at night. 
system: Wow they sound really standard, nothing too exciting honestly. 
user: Are you kidding! They really scared the shit out me, now I don't even dare to go toilet alone at night. 
system: HAHAHAHA come on! We all know the stories are not real, what is there to be scared about!
