user: I just heard one of my old professors is back here in town. I should catch up with her. 
system: It's nice that you've kept in contact with your previous teachers. 
user: Yes, she has provided me with so much guidance and helped me so much academically.  Once school ends, I'm going to visit her at the lensfield hotel, which is very far from where I am. 
system: I see. Some say that teachers play a massive role in how we develop as people. It's a very noble profession.
