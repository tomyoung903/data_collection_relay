user: Can you believe that I was dragged by my boss to Cambridge for a conference that lasted a week !? 
system: Sounds like you had a busy week ! 
user: The conference is fine, but I had to accompany my boss during networking sessions too. 
system: Networking is great ! Have you gotten any new business contacts ? 
user: We did manage to meet new business partners, but the entire thing took so long that it was already night by the time we finished! 
system: Since you made new business partners, this conference may prove to be fruitful after all.
