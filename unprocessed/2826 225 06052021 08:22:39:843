user: should I bring an umbrella?
system: well it is always good to have an umbrella on hand, but the chance of raining is only 20% for that day, and the journey is mostly sheltered.
user: got it man, what time does the museum close?
system: It closes at 5.30pm, take note that it does not open during the weekends!
user: Thanks for the reminder, or I would have planned a trip during the weekend...
system: no problem!
