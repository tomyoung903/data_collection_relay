user: A movie night sounds great. Should I download some movies on Netflix? I can't decide what to watch though.
system: Would you like me to suggest some movies?
user: I think it's ok for now. I can ask my friends what genre they prefer later.
system: Ok. Can I help you with anything else?
user: Nope. I'm good for now! Thanks.
system: No problem. Enjoy your short stay there.
