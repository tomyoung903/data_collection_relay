system: Looking at artifacts and exhibitions can be a relaxing way to pass time.
user: I heard there are quite some popular ones littered around town
system: Are you from around this region? 
user: No, I am driving up further north to visit my aunt but my car broke down. Now I am holed up at Trent motel while waiting for my ride to get fixed.
system: Trent is on the west of the river which cuts through the town center. The museums there are indeed the highlight of the town
