user: You too! I hope my kids have fun on this family trip.






system: I think they will. How many children are you travelling with?






user: I'm travelling with 3 kids. One of the them, my youngest son, is extremely picky about his food and where he stays. Sigh.






system: Oh dear, that must be tough for you. Is that why you've cancelled the enquiry on the previous options for your restaurant and guesthouse?





user: Yes it is, because my son suddenly changed his mind. It's so hard to please youngsters these days.






system: Yes, it does seem that way indeed, doesn't it? Perhaps we were like that when we were younger too.
