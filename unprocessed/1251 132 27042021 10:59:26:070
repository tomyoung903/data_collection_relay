user: That'll be nice. I think my friends would enjoy that after our meal.
system: They most likely would, especially since you'd be treating them.
user: Oh no, Sunday's breakfast is my treat but I can't afford treating all 5 of us to the play! It will burn a big hole in my pocket.
system: Ah yes that is indeed a problem if you don't have deep pockets.
user: Yeah. I mean, I am generous, but not that generous you know?
system: Maybe. But generous enough to treat your friends to an expensive restaurant, which is something.
