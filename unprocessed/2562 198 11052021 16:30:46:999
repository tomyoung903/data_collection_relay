user: My little sister is feeling really hyped for the trip.
system: That sounds lovely! Are the both of you going on a trip together?
user: Yes, only the both of us. This is exciting.
system: I am happy for you. Is this your first time going on a solo trip with your sister?
user: Yes, and I am on a tight budget.
system: I see why you were initially reluctant to book a hotel that is more on the pricey side. Not to worry, the ambience there is good. And you can use the free wifi to search for other affordable ways to spend your trip!
user: Yes, as long as we have a good time, I will not worry about anything else.
system: That's the spirit!
