user: My father and I are planning to do some sports but since there are no sport venues visiting a college will do. Do you think my father will enjoy the place?
system: Does your father enjoy books? The college has a wide variety of literature that I think your father might find interesting.
user: That's great! He's always complaining about contemporary literature.
system: The college has a large collection of old literature that I'm sure he will enjoy.
user: That will be a great trip then!
