user: I would appreciate it very much. 
system: All done. Are you going on a solo trip? 
user: Yes, kind of. I'm meeting my friend there. 
system: Oh, is it a date? 
user: Not really, though I do wish it was. 
system: It sounds like the person you're meeting holds a significant importance in your life. 
user: How did you know? 
system: The fact that you're willing to travel all the way there just to meet up with said person. That definitely gave it away. 
user: Well, she's my best friend and I'm secretly in love with her. 
system: Oh, wow. Have you confessed your feelings yet? 
user: I am definitely planning to. On the day I arrive there. 
system: On Thursday! Wow, that's amazing. All the best and I hope the feeling's mutual.
