user: Is it weird for a guy and a girl to be staying in a room together? 
system: Definitely not. It's just 3 days. Are you all friends? 
user: Yes, just friends. Nothing more than that. 
system: Well, if it gets awkward, just utilise the free wifi and have your eyes glued to your screen. 
user: That's a useful tip!  
system: You're welcome.
