user: It's alright. One of my clients has decided to move home. 
system: Alright. Does that mean you have to sell their home? 
user: Yes and also find them a replacement. 
system: Good for business.  
user: It is but they frankly have unrealistic expectations on the sale price of their home. 
system: Oh. Have you told them this? 
user: Not yet. I want to do more research and be absolutely sure. For now, I'm more focused on finding them a place to move into. 
system: Do you have any other places they may be interested in? 
user: Yes, they liked two out of the 5 options I presented to them. But they are hoping that if their home sells at their desired price, they will be able to splurge. 
system: It's not good to have unrealistic expectations.  
user: I know. I just need to find the right moment at the right place at the right time. 
system: Perhaps you could tell them at the Arms. That way, being cocooned in luxury, they might just be vulnerable enough to understand,
