user: My kid has been begging me to take him to a swimmingpool but I really don't want to. 
system: Why not, I don't see any danger coming out of it. 
user: I think public swimmingpool is really dirty, think about all those people who just piss inside and hair and everything, god I want to puke. 
system: It is really not as bad as you think, there's a lot of chlorine so it kills the germs, and they routinely dispel of the water!
