user: He's going to turn 10 next week. I hope to surprise him by taking him on a trip after his school finishes. 
system: That's very thoughtful of you. Have you gotten him any present yet?
user: I have bought him a puzzle set. He's a big fan of them. I hope it's enough though.
system: Don't worry. I'm sure he will also enjoy the beautiful outdoors at the country park.
user: Yeah. He's a very active young child. He reminds me of myself when I was younger.
system: Time flies pretty fast. Happy advanced birthday to your nephew on my behalf!
