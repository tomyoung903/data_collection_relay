user: Hey can we chat about history? 
system: History? What about it? 
user: I like how humans try so hard to piece fragments of information together to tell a story, even if sometimes, there just isn't one. 
system: Telling stories is what humans do best. We all try and fit our logic on to the unknown. 
user: It's been a long time since I've visited a museum... Maybe it's time I drop by one. 
system: That's a pretty good place to see the history for yourself.
