system: Are you a big fan of dinosaurs. 
user: Absolutely, I even wanted to be an archaeologist when I was young haha. Good times! 
system: Damn and what happened to the dream. 
user: Well reality hit me and I ended up studying engineering. Sad I know. 
system: Well at least you still keep it as a hobby. 
user: Indeed, I will be visiting the museum later, the bones of these gigantic creatures are always amazing. 
system: I agree, unbelievable that they have once roamed the world and is an animal just like what we see today.
