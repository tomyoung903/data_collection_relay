user: We have been travelling cheaply for a while now and apparently my father is craving spicy food. 
system: I think he will enjoy the restaurant then! Indian cuisine do serve some fairly spicy food. 
user: Right? I hope the food isn't too spicy though. I have very low spice tolerance and I will definitely get a stomach ache. 
system: You can get non-spicy food or get some cold water at the restaurant to help with the spice. 
user: That's a good idea! 
system: Eating more spicy foods can train your spice tolerance. You can look into that so that you can enjoy more spicy foods next time!
