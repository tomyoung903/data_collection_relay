user: What are your thoughts on Bridge Guest House? Is it a good place to stay?
system: Well, that depends. What are you specifically looking for?
user: I am looking for anything that isn't boring.
system: Well, there are more than 30 hotels or guesthouses in the south. Maybe you could make new friends from all over the world there?
user: I'm not too sure. I am not particularly good at making friends.
system: Well, worse comes to worst, you can always rely on the free wifi.
user: That's true. Thanks.
system: No problem.
