user: My friend has invited me over to her place to hang out ! 
system: It is nice of you to visit your friend. 
user: But my friend will not be at home until the evening comes. I need to kill some time until then. 
system: That is unfortunate. Hopefully you can find something fun to do. 
user: I love art and history. Maybe I can look around a museum while I wait for my friend. 
system: Museums sounds great ! You get to learn while killing time.
