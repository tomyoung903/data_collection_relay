user: I met this really cute girl the other day and we're going on a date. 
system: Congratulations!  
user: The thing is, she wants to go to a museum for the date. 
system: That sounds like a fun activity. Is there a problem? 
user: Yes, because I don't know anything about them. 
system: Maybe you could start by picking a location where you'd like to go.
