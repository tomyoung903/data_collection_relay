user: We've been together for 10 years. 
system: Congratulations. You guys finally hit the double digits. 
user: Thank you. She's been so stressed with work lately. I'm hoping some time away will let her relax. Maybe we could get some massages together. 
system: That's true. Maybe there is a spa in Lensfield? That would help you out. 
user: Oh, that would be convenient. Although I'll have to find a way to keep my son occupied. 
system: Don't worry. I'm sure he will enjoy watching his favourite cartoons with the free wifi.  
user: That's true. He can stay glued to a screen for hours. I have to forcibly turn off our tv at home sometimes. 
system: It's the new generation of devices everywhere. We all are glued to our screens. 
user: Fair point. In this case, I will excuse him. Anything to keep my wife relaxed. I'm very grateful for your advice 
system: No worries. Your wife is lucky to have you.
