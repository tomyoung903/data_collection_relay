user: My girlfriend is from Cambridge and she has been asking me to go there with her for the longest time. I think she wants to introduce me to her family. 
system: Ah, are you planning to take her there then? 
user: I think so. We are relatively free these few days. So I have no reason to object to it. 
system: Do you guys already have specific places you want to go to.
