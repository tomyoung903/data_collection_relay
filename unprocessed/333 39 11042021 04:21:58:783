user: I am really excited for my next week's plan. My company decided to give me an opportunity to work in the overseas branch for a week! 
system: It is a good chance, I am glad to hear that.
user: I will choose to travel by airplane next week, although travelling by sea is indeed cheaper, but takes too long time.
system: I agree that planes are the most convenient transportation nowadays.
user: But it is really inconvenient for me to go abroad. The Stansted Airport is too far from my place.
system: I understand your dissatisfaction, people will travel more easily if there are more airports.
