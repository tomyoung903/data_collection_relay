user: I think less and less people are going to theatres nowadays. 
system: Why is that so? 
user: Last time sales in theatres used to be really popular, tickets would run out in minutes, but nowadays you can get one like minutes before a play. 
system: Sounds really sad, I wonder what happened. 
user: I guess it is the rise of a large amount of alternative means of entertainment, and also theatres are not cheap to be fair. 
system: I see, do you still go?
