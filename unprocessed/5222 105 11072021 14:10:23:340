user: My friend Dan wants to bring me to a nightclub, but I don't really wanna go. 
system: Why not? Nightclubs could be a good hangout! 
user: The noisy environment, and the crowd... I just don't really like it. I prefer a quieter environment I guess. 
system: Hmm, but nightclubs can be a nice place for you to interact and socialize with more people! Perhaps you should just try it out! 
user: Really? But I've never visited one! And I don't think I'm a good drinker. 
system: Don't worry. It doesn't hurt to give it a try! Also, instead of alcohol, you can have some other beverages insteadÔºÅ
