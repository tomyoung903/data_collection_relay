user: My son is graduating from university soon. 
system: That's great. Congratulations. 
user: He deserves the felicitations. He's been working so hard for the past few years. 
system: What major was he pursuing? 
user: Electrical and Electronic Engineering. It is extremely taxing, he barely had time for himself. 
system: That sucks. 
user: Yes, but he can finally breathe now. He is really excited to travel with his girlfriend. I want to spend as much time with him before he flies off. 
system: That is adorable.  
user: I hope so. My wife on the other hand is writing a check for his travels. 1 followed with a lot of zeros. As if I hadn't already spent a fortune on his education. 
system: Good thing you are going to a moderately priced restaurant then.
