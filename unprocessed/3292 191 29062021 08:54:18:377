user: Nothing much. I sure hope I make a good impression on my date. 
system: First date? 
user: Yes, we met on the internet and she mentioned she is a history buff.  
system: The museum sounds like a great first date plan then.  
user: That is what I am counting on.  
system: Maybe you should read up on some artifacts as well, as a way to impress her. 
user: You know what, that actually sounds like a great idea, thank you. 
system: Always happy to help.
