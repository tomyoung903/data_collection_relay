user: Not too sure. I'm still waiting on my friends to tell me when they are ready to leave. 
system: Alright. Are you and your friends just hanging out? 
user: Yeah. But more importantly, one of our mates is getting married. 
system: That's great news. Congratulations to him. 
user: I'll convey it to him. I'm surprised he took so long to find someone. 
system: Why is that? 
user: In university he was always the playboy, getting girls left and right. Yet now, everyone in our circle is married except for him. 
system: Maybe he took his time to pick the right partner. 
user: Hahaha. Any person who would want to marry him is probably the right partner.  
system: That's good for him. Did you guys get him any presents? 
user: Nope. But did we plan out his bachelor party. And oh boy it's going to be great but the final bill wasn't that great. 
system: Well, then you guys shouldn't have booked such expensive rooms then.
