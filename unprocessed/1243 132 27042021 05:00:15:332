user: Hmm...well my son loves to read. He's a bit of a nerd, so maybe somewhere quiet and not too crowded would be good, if that's possible. As for me, I love looking at scenic places.
system: Oh not to worry, I am somewhat of a nerd as well. I would recommend visiting Heffers, where your son can browse and buy a myriad of different genres. As for yourself, you might like to go on a guided river tour down River Cam.
user: That sounds good. So how do we go to Heffers? I think both of us would enjoy the tour too. Where do I book it? Thank you!
system: You're very welcome. Heffers is actually just a 6 minute walk from Christ's College, so if you'd like a break from visiting the college you might want to pop by the bookstore quickly. More information can be found on: https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/shops. As for the tour, you may book it through this website: https://activities.timeout.com/en-gb/cambridge-l439/45-minute-tour-of-cambridge-by-chauffeured-punt-t10868/.
user: Thank you! I sure hope my son enjoys this trip.
system: He definitely would, especially since you've put in so much effort planning. Have fun on your trip!
