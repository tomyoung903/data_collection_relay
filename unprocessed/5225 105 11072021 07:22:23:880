user: My friend was telling me about a new night market in Cambridge and it sounds really interesting! 
system: Hmm, I don't think I have heard of it. What is it all about? 
user: It is a night market that opened recently! My friend also mentioned that they serve really good Asian food!

user: According to my friend, it tastes pretty good, and I really want to try it out for myself as well!  
system: That sure sounds cool! Do tell me more about it after you have tasted it!
