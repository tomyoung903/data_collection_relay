user: Alright. I'll keep that in mind. I'm doing some house hunting. 
system: That's nice. Are you having any issues with your current home? 
user: Not necessarily. My wife and I are just looking to upgrade as we are finally deciding to start a family. 
system: That's amazing.  
user: It is, but having kids requires more space and a lot of money. I can't be spending money unnecessarily. 
system: Good thing you are saving on the guesthouse then.
