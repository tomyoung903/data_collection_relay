user: I desperately need to be somewhere else by Tuesday. Another continent if possible. 
system: What's happening on Tuesday? 
user: My mother-in-law will be in town and I must be out of here at all costs.  
system: Oh dear, that sounds like trouble. Do you already have a place to go to? 
user: I don't, but it does not matter as long as I'm not here. 
system: You might as well have a fun time since you will be out of town.
