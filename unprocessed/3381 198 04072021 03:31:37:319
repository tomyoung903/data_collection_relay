user: Just one question. Before I make the call for reservation, what should I eat there? 
system: Well, there are many types of Korean food. I think the classic 'Bibimbap' (mixed rice) or 'Budae Jjigae' (army stew) would be some great options. 
user: I love army stew! But isn't it spicy? 
system: Yes, army stew is usually spicy. You could try to request them to reduce the spiciness if you can't take spice. It's worth a try, at least. 
user: Sometimes I get diarrhoea when it's too spicy. 
system: Oh no, it's better to avoid having to go through that.  
user: Yes, that would be ideal. I will call the restaurant now. 
system: Okay.
