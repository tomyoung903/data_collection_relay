user: Honestly, it's great that 4-star hotels can be affordable too. It's so difficult to find good accommodation nowadays. I hope my family enjoys the trip. 
system: It does seem like price points are high for quality hotels. I'm sure, there's still gonna be gems here and there, just like Allenbell! Just hit me up if you need any more help. Anyway, have an awesome family trip!
