user: Hey have you ever heard about the legend of King Arthur. 
system: I don't think I have, what about it? 
user: Dude so in the legend, there is this island called avalon and that was where the legendary sword was forged. 
system: Okay and what is the point you want to make actually? 
user: Dude I didn't know they have a placed named Avalon as well! I am here right now and it feels so mystical hahaha. 
system: Ah so that's why you asked, is there anything special about the place then? 
user: Well not really actually, but it is just really cool when you see signs and all and they say Avalon. 
system: Hahahha I see! You sound like an excited child who just saw the tooth fairy or something.
