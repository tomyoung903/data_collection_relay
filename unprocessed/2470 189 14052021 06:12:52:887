user: I'm not sure whether the would like the food. Should I try inviting them for lunch or dinner at non local joint?






system: Why not. Life is all about trying out new and exciting things.






user: What if they don't like the chinese food served at the place we go to?






system: You can always find a new place to try. Eventually, you all will find a place that you commonly like.
