user: I have a very tight schedule today. I need to travel to many places. 
system: You can travel from one place to another through taxis at the shortest possible time! 
user: That’s a good recommendation! There are some places where I think is hard to navigate to. 
system: I am sure you can navigate the driver to your desired place if he’s unsure of the direction. He will be more than willing to. 
user: I hope so. I need some buffer time to prepare for my events too! 
system: You can finish some of your planning in the ride if it permits! It’s going to be time efficient!
