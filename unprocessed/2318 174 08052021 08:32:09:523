system: You should disconnect yourself from the world and reconnect with yourself. Prioritize yourself first! Care for yourself physically, mentally and emotionally. Disconnect from your phone and immerse yourself in a hobby. It can be anything your heart desires, so long you enjoy the activity you have chosen.
