user: So, I just received a call from my close friend. 
system: What was it about? 
user: She was complaining that we have not met each other in months, and wanted a meet-up. 
system: It's always nice to catch up with friends. Have you two made any plans? 
user: Oh of course. We're both really busy recently and the little time we have together is really precious. I'll be leaving from nandos city centre to meet her later today. 
system: Indeed, work seems to have been hectic these days. You've had little time for yourself.
