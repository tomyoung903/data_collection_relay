user: Something's wrong, My friend told me to meet at 4 but its already 415. 
system: You should check on her and see if everything is okay. 
user: Yeah I just texted her, maybe I should just call her instead. 
system: Is she usually late? If she isn't, give her a call. 
user: Oh my god she just replied, she remembered the wrong meeting place and went to Nandos instead what the heck?! 
system: Hahahah, so is she going to coming over?
