user: That's great. Some of my high school buddies are coming over this week.  
system: Oh wow. What's the occasion? 
user: We are having a reunion over the weekend. Drinks, a nice bbq, long chats about how life has treated them. 
system: I see. How long has it been since you guys last met? 
user: Oh gosh. It's been a while. I would say 5-6 years. They all moved out of town over the years.  
system: Ah alright. I'm sure it will be a great reunion. 
user: I sure hope so too. Normally I would invite them over to my place. But it would get too crowded. 
system: It's alright. I'm sure they know. Plus, they would definitely love to park their cars for free 
user: That's true. My garage isn't that big. They'd have to park on the street and pay the toll. 
system: Yup. Hope you guys have a good time.
