user: I’m having a horrible case of writer’s block.  
system: That’s too bad. What are you writing? 
user: I’m writing a novel, but the ideas just won’t flow.  
system: Maybe you should go outside for some inspiration? 
user: I’ve already tried that but it didn’t work. It’s kinda boring here.  
system: That’s too bad.  
user: Maybe I’ll try leaving leaving Bishops Strotford. A change in scenery might just give me the inspiration I need.  
system: All the best with that! I hope you find what you’re looking for
