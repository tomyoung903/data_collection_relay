user: That's great. I think I'm a bad father. 
system: Why do you think so? 
user: I forgot my son's birthday. This is why I had to do such last-minute plans. 
system: How come you forgot your son's birthday? 
user: I have no idea. Guess I was just so caught up in work. It's been a hectic past few days.  
system: Tough times at the office? 
user: Yeap. We and two other companies are fighting over this client. We had to revise our proposal at least 5 times in the past week. 
system: Did you land the client at least? 
user: Yes, we finally did. But at the cost of me not planning anything for my sons birthday. My wife kept reminding me, but it kept slipping my mind. 
system: Oh, dear. Tell me is your son a fan of history? 
user: Yeap. His favourite subject in school. 
system: I'm sure he'll appreciate a good museum. 
user: That's what I was banking on. 
system: Don't worry. Just don't repeat this again.
