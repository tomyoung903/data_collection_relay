user: My high school best friend is coming to visit this weekend. I haven't seen her in over a decade. 
system: Oh wow. You must be looking forward to it. 
user: Yes. I'm so excited I planned the whole week's itinerary. 
system: What do you have planned? 
user: I'm going to take her to one of my favourite pubs here first, then cook her brunch the next day. 
system: Wow! That's so thoughtful. 
user: Haha. That's not all. I'm going to take her and my family to a showing of the new Shakespeare play at Cambridge. 
system: That's lovely! I'm sure she'll appreciate it.
