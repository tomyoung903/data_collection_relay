user: Today's the first time my boss had entrusted me to plan something big. 
system: What did they ask you to do? 
user: She asked me to plan a team-building outing for my subordinates and my colleagues. 
system: That sounds like an enormous responsibility. 
user: It is. On one hand I'm glad that my boss is finally recognising my efforts, but on the other I'm worried that I might mess something up. 
system: I'm sure you'll do great, don't let fear hold you back. Do you have anything in mind? 
user: The given corporate travel budget is quite substantial, and my boss did seem to encourage a trip outside peterborough.  
system: I see, I'm sure that you'll be able to pull this off.
