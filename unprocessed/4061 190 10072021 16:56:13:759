system: I am sure it won’t be. You can talk to people that are also alone at the museum. You might end up being friends. 
user: I hope they are willing to make friends with strangers!

user: That’s a good advice. I will try. 
system: Just be yourself! I am sure you will gain something through this trip to the museum!
