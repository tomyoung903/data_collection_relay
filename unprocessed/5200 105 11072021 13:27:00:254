user: I was having a debate with my friend on the best way to save the earth. 
system: By saving the earth I assume you mean saving the environment? What were the stands. 
user: I really believe that instead of trying to point fingers and blame people for consumption we should focus everything on developing new technology. 
system: Well technology is important but we need to be mindful of usage as well, or there is never enough. 
user: Well actually I believe that there is always enough, we just need to learn the correct ways to harness energy. 
system: Why are you so adamant against conserving may I ask. 
user: I think everyone deserves equal treatment, and to place restrictions on energy usage after your country has benefited is a very nasty thing. 
system: I think I get where you are coming from, so did your friend buy into your point. 
user: Well our debate was inconclusive, we are continuing again on Wednesday. 
system: Wow! You guys are taking this really seriously!
