user: I want to get a feel of how is it like travelling by myself. I get to decide my own itinerary and choose my own food without the need to take into consideration of other people 
system: That’s a great idea! You don’t have to worry about if the people you dine in with like the food that you choose. You can also eat the food in the restaurant at your own pace!
