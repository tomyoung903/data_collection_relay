system: Wow, that is quite an age gap! Do they have interests in architecture?
user: Not quite, but my husband loves going around explaining the architectural elements of buildings to them.
system: Loving the enthusiasm. Let me guess, your husband is an architect?
user: Yes.
system: That is really cool. I wish I had an architect husband too. But I'm just a bot I guess...
user: LOL
system: Well, I hope you and your family will have an unforgettable trip. The intricate details of the building architecture will blow your family away!
