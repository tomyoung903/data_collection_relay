user: It is the first time my friend, Ben, has tried Indian food. It was difficult to get him to try new food since he's only willing to eat swiss food.
system: It is good to try new things. It's great that you managed to convince him to try new foods.
user: Right. Indian food is very delicious. He is missing out.
system: Indian food has a very rich culture and is very delicious. I'm sure Ben would appreciate your efforts in convincing him to try it out.
user: I hope so! 
system: Enjoy the food at Royal Spice! Their name sounds like they serve food that's fit for 'Royalty' haha!
