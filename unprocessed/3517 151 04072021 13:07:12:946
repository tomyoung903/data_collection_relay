user: Not for now. My daughter wants to visit a few museums for a history project. 
system: What is the project about? 
user: The local and rural history of Britain. 
system: Ah, that's nice. 
user: I asked her why can't just do her research online. She said her teacher recommended her visit and talk to museum caretakers. 
system: I see. Does your daughter love history? 
user: Absolutely. It's her favourite subject. I have never seen her be so passionate about anything before. 
system: It's good she has something she likes.  
user: That's true. The only issue I have is we are going to have to walk around a lot. We are going to be quite tired. 
system: It's okay. Relaxing in a 4 star room shouldn't be too bad.
