user: I had some very good takeaway the other day. 
system: Where was it from? 
user: My coworker bought it from some place called the good luck chinese food takeaway. Although, he says that even though the name is like that they also have dine in. 
system: It sounds like it is worth a visit if you liked it so much. 
user: I only tried one appetiser from there though and I do not know anything else about the place so I'm not sure if it is worth going to. 
system: Nothing ventured, nothing gained as they say.
