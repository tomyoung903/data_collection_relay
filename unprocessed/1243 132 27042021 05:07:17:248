user: Hmm...well my son loves to read. He's a bit of a nerd, so maybe somewhere quiet and not too crowded would be good, if that's possible. As for me, I love looking at scenic places.
system: Oh not to worry, I am somewhat of a nerd as well. I would recommend visiting Heffers, where your son can browse and buy a myriad of different genres. As for yourself, you might like to go on a guided river tour down River Cam.
user: That sounds good. I'll read up on these places before booking a trip. I sure hope my son enjoys this trip.
system: He definitely would, especially since you've put in so much effort planning. 
user: You don't know him though. He's an angsty teenager who doesn't want to be seen with his dad.
system: Boy, do they grow up fast don't they?
user: Yeah, it feels like just yesterday when he was such a tiny baby. Anyway thanks for your help, I've got to head to work now.
system: You're very welcome! Have a good day at work and enjoy your upcoming trip!
