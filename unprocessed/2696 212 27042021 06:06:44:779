user: Wow! That sounds convenient, what if I am not able to get a ride through the app?
system: There are multiple cab companies for you to hire a ride! Any preferences for you?
user: It is alright, I should be able to get a few off Google.  Hopefully, the weather will be good.
system: I am sure there will be nice places for you to sit and wait until the rain stops if you do not want to call a cab. I shall wish for dry and wonderful weather when you are out on your trip!
