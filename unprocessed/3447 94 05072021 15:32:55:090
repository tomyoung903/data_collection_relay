user: I am going to visit my friend in the west side of town. 
system: It is nice of you to visit your friend. 
user: But my friend will not be at home until the evening comes. I need to kill some time until then. 
system: That is unfortunate. Hopefully you can find something fun to do. 
user: Maybe I can try a museum. I have yet to find one here. 
system: Museums sounds great ! You get to learn while killing time.
