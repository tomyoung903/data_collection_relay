user: I have to shoot an educational film for a college module. 
system: That sounds like a cool assignment. 
user: Yeah, but I'm a bit lost. I booked an appointment with the Director of the Museum of Classical Archaeology here. Hopefully, he can clear some of my doubts. 
system: Oh, that's smart. Have you already picked your subject then? 
user: Yeah, well, I'm doing something based on archaeology. It's the specifics I need help with. 
system: I'm sure the Director will help you out with that.
