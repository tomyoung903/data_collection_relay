user: I met this really cute girl the other day and we're going on a date. 
system: Congratulations!  
user: I am looking forward to it, but the only thing is that she wants to go to a museum for the date. 
system: That sounds like a fun activity. Is there a problem? 
user: Yes, because I don't know anything about them so I don't know where to go. 
system: That sounds difficult. Maybe you could start by picking a location where you'd like to go and narrow down your options.
