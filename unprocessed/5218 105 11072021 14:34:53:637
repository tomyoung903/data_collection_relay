user: My friend had a huge fight with some strangers last night it was hilarious. 
system: I hope he is okay! Why would you think that it is funny. 
user: Well I mean they were both drunk and they were absolutely missing all the punches they throw. 
system: Yeah but that is still scary, is he okay? 
user: Yeah he is fine, we are here in Kings Lynn and there are lots of hospitals, nothing to worry about. 
system: Well as his friend you should make sure he doesn't get that drunk again.
