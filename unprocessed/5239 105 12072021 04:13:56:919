user: Ah I missed this place, the last I was here I brawled on the streets. 
system: Jeez where are you, and why are you recalling it like it's fond memories. 
user: I am at London liverpool street. And it is indeed fond memories! Youth is meant to be spent like that. 
system: That is ridiculous, what is so fun about being hurt and hurting people. 
user: The fun is about fighting alongside your brothers! And now I am in my 40's even if I want to brawl again that's not possible 
system: Damn the fight must have taken a toll on you, you sound out of your mind.
