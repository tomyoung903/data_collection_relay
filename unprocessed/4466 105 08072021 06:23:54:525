user: My mom is a historian, so she used to take me to museums when I was young, and we would spend literally the whole day in there as she tells me the stories behind the artifacts. 
system: Sounds really sweet! Did you become a historian as well? 
user: Unfortunately no haha, I became a writer. I guess its somewhat related. 
system: A writer! She must be really proud of you nonetheless. 
user: I wonder. She just passed away recently, I will never find out, we never talked much after I grew up. 
system: I am so sorry to hear that.
