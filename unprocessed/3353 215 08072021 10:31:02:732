user: Since this is a holiday I planned for my older relatives and grandparents, is the Castle Galleries elderly-friendly? 
system: castle galleries' staff are all very patient. I think your family members should not have much of an issue. 
user: that is reassuring! hopefully my family have a good time there and I don't burn a hole in my wallet. 
system: It is the company that matters, you don't necessarily have to spend a ton to have fun.
