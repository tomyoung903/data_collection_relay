user: My friends and I have been touring around bishops stortford for the past 2 days. 
system: How was the experience? 
user: It was great. We got to see places that can't be found in urban areas, like town markets and historical sites. 
system: It's nice to step away from the bustling city life once in a while. 
user: Indeed. I think the highlight for me was Mountfitchet Castle. That place looks like it's straight out of a video game. 
system: Wow, that sounds like quite the sight.  
user: Too bad we'll have to leave for our next location soon.  
system: Well, you could always visit again, perhaps with your family next time.
