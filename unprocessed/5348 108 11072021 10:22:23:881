user: A bunch of my extended relatives are coming to town for vacation. I hate it when they come over. 
system: It sounds like quite a party, why do you dislike it? 
user: They are very competitive. Especially when it comes to their homeland, they are very proud of it.

user: They told me there is no way I can find good chinese food outside of china. 
system: I disagree! Anything is possible if you can find it.
