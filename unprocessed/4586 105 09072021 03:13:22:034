user: My friend Steve wants to meet me this Friday to catch up. Weird. 
system: Why would it be weird? 
user: Well we were never close enough to need to "catch up". I feel like he's going to sell me insurance. 
system: Hahaha honestly I think that is very possible, why did you agree to meet him then.
