user: Hello system, can you tell me what day is it? I kind of having trouble remembering the date since the lockdown started.
system: Hello user, it is Saturday, 8 May 2021. Would you like to know the weather forecast for today?
user: No, thank you. I prefer not to. These days, the weather has been not that great and it's okay not to know the forecast.
system: Sorry, I don't quite get what you mean. Do you mind repeating it again?
user: No, it's okay. Thank you. I think I won't be explaining anything more than that.
system: Okay, noted on that. I'll respect your decision. What do you want me to do else?
