user: It's alright. We are moving over to a new home. 
system: Nice. Congratulations. What made you guys move? 
user: The old house was getting too cramped for us. We needed more space. 
system: I see. Does the new home do the trick? 
user: Yeap. It's a duplex so we'll even have a second floor. 
system: That's great. So have you guys moved already? 
user: Yeap more or less. My wife and I loved the new place so much that we started moving stuff well before we needed to. We still need some things to be set up so we are setting up temporary accommodations for a few days. 
system: I see. It's good that you guys moved early. You all must really love this place. 
user: Amen. The best homes also cost a lot of money though. 
system: It's definitely an investment worth making. And plus you are saving up while at the Belfry.
