user: I am thinking of visiting other counties. There's not enough things to do here at home in Cambridge ! 
system: Visiting counties ? Will you be going on a trip around the country then ? 
user: Nope, I think I am going to pick out a few counties to visit for a few days. 
system: There are many counties to choose from though... Which county will be your first stop ? 
user: I have a friend living in Leichester that I can call up to hang out with. So I will start from there. 
system: Having friends to go out with sounds like fun !  How will you be getting there ?
