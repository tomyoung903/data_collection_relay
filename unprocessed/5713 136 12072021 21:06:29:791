user: I was thinking of something pricey because my uncle said I could use his credit card but too bad. 
system: Haha well the A&B and Carolina are not too cheap either so you can still take advantage of his card. 
user: That is true! He said it was in return for helping him out at work after all. 
system: I shouldn't be encouraging you to exploit his card I would do the same if I were in your shoes haha! 
user: I'm going see what else I can spend on then! 
system: Have fun but don't spend too much ok?
