user: My mom simply loves to go to Cambridge. 
system: Why is that so if I may ask. 
user: She has some strange obsessions with the university there. She's dragging me to go there again this week. 
system: Hahaha just go with her, she's your mom, treasure your time together. 
user: I mean I don't mind spending time with her but not always the same place! 
system: Have you asked her why she's obsessed with the university?
