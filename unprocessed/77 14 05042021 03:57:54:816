user: I'm so excited for my upcoming trip to Cambridge! I've been wanting to get out of town for a while now. I need a break. I've been so stressed at work.
system: It's a great chance for you to unwind.
user: That's right. But there's just one pesky task I need to deal with before I can enjoy myself.
system: What's that?
user: Getting myself proper transport.
system: Don't worry, I can do it for you now. You're going on a trip. It doesn't make sense for it to give you more stress.
