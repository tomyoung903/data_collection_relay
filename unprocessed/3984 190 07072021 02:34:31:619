user: Some of my friends are not punctual.  
system: It’s good to remind them to come to the restaurant on time so that all of your food orders can be taken at one go. It can be convenient for the waiter!  
user: I agree. It’s hard for the waiters if there is a large group. 
system: It will be challenging and tough on the waiter if all of you ask for separate checks at the end of the meal.  
user: I think one person should pay and we split the check after the meal. 
system: That will be a great idea! It will save time on the waiter side and make his or her life even easier!
