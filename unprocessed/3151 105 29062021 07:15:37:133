user: Do you know if they do COVID testing at stansted airport? 
system: I'm not sure. Why do you ask? 
user: Got a flight to catch and I need to make sure I don't miss it 
system: If I were you I'd just go the night before, much better to wait than to miss it. 
user: Fair point. This COVID situation is really becoming a pain in the ass. 
system: I know right. But theres really nothing much we can do other than settling into the new norms.
