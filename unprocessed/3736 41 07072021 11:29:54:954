user: I've recently been to a trampoline park. 
system: Cool! I've heard that you could do all sorts of stunts there. 
user: That's right. Challenging feats like backflips and slam dunks instantly become a piece of cake with the trampolines. 
system: That sounds like so much fun. It must be exhilarating to jump through the air like that. 
user: I've wanted to go to one again, but there aren't any trampoline parks here in London Liverpool Street. 
system: Oh, that's a real shame.
