user: my family love noodles, this sounds like a good option! are the food spicy though? my younger siblings can't take spicy food. 
system: I think your siblings can find one that suits their tastes with the wide variety there. 
user: great. do i need to pay to park my car? 
system: no. Are you taking your family shopping in town after lunch since you are looking for a place to eat in the centre? 
user: indeed. it has been quite long since we've been out on a shopping trip, I wanted to get my parents some presents. 
system: that's really sweet of you. I'm sure your parents are very proud of you.
