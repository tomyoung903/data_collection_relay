user: It's my grandmother's birthday soon and my whole family will be visiting her. 
system: That's so sweet!  
user: Yes! Also, my grandmother stays not too far from our house here in cambridge so it won't take long. 
system: Nice! Have you guys gone to your grandmother's place often? 
user: Not really, it's been a long time since we visited. I already forgot how to go there. 
system: Do you have any preference for mode of transport?
