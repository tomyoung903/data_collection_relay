user: Okay. Train rides are always so boring. 
system: Why don't you download some movies and watch it on the ride? Or you could read some books too!

system: Why zero stars though?  
user: Well, tight budget. I can barely afford to take a holiday.  
system: It's okay, you need to rest sometimes!
