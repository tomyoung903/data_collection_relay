user: I am buying a pokemon collectible card from this guy but he seems a little suspicious. 
system: In what way? 
user: Just the way he texts and the photos of the item he sent, something feels off about this guy. 
system: Well you better be careful! Where are you meeting him at? 
user: I asked him to trade at London Liverpool Street Train Station, public places so if anything goes wrong he can't do anything to me. 
system: Why do you still want to meet him despite the suspicion?
