user: I'm meeting up with my ex-project members. It's been a while since I last saw them. 
system: Is everyone turning up? 
user: There were actually 8 members, including me, but one of them is on an exchange programme at the moment. 
system: I see. 7 is quite a big group for a project. What was the project about? 
user: It was a competition actually. We teamed up to build a robot and came in third place. That was three years ago. 
system: It's amazing that you and your members are still in contact with each other. 
user: I wasn't expecting to be able to make such great friends through the competition too. We are all still in contact and holding meetups annually. 
system: Such lasting friendships are hard to come by. This is definitely something worth treasuring. 
user: It sure is. I can't wait to see them again.
