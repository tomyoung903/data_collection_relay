user: I have a date on that day. I hope I can impress my crush. 
system: A movie date at the cinema is a good choice provided you are relatively comfortable with her and it's not your first few dates. You can share your opinion on the movie and spend quality time together! 
user: It's been like ten plus dates already. I have known her for a few years. Why is it bad for a first date though? 
system: In my opinion, you won't be able to talk for close to two hours depending on the movie length and therefore, you can't get to know more about her. 
user: In that case, where should I bring her to? 
system: You can choose a more sociable place so that both of you will have a meaningful conversation with one another!
