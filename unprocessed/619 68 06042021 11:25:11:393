user: It has been long since I last met my dad.
system: How long has it been?
user: About a year. He is coming to visit me though.
system: Great! You can spend some time together.
user: He is flying here so I hope he won't be so jetlagged.
system: Hope he has a safe flight.
user: Yeah, he is not too familiar with directions, his plane touches down at the stansted airport, I think I will go and pick him up there.
system: That sounds like a great plan.
