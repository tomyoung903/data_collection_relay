user: I just visited my friend staying at Bishops Stortford, he seems to have it real tough. 
system: What happened to him? I hope it gets better for him. 
user: His dog just died and he lost his job, now he is running out of savings and might just be homeless. 
system: God that is terrible! I'm sure you are going to help him out a bit?
