user: Why does it sometimes feel that every important thing happens on a single day? 
system: What do you mean by that? 
user: It's been pretty uneventful for me for the past couple of months, and suddenly I have a couple of plans clashing later! 
system: I'm sorry to hear that, will you just be going for one? 
user: No, I think it's best that I'll try to make it for both, even if I'll be late for the second event. 
system: Better late than never. What will you be doing later? 
user: I'm meeting with one of my friends at the gardenia, afterwards I'm meeting with a colleague at another place. 
system: I hope that you'll have a great time.
