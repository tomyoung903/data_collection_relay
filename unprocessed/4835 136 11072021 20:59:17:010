user: We have been travelling cheaply for a while now and apparently my father is craving spicy food. 
system: I think he will enjoy the restaurant then! Indian cuisine do serve some fairly spicy food. 
user: Right? I hope the food isn't too spicy though. I have very low spice tolerance and I will definitely get a stomach ache. 
system: I'm sure the restaurant serves non-spicy food as well. 
user: Yes they should. Or I can always get a glass of cold water. 
system: Eating more spicy foods can train your spice tolerance. You can look into that so that you can enjoy more spicy foods next time!
