user: My granduncle just passed away. 
system: I am so sorry to hear that. But as they say, death is a part of the journey, talk to people if you need to. 
user: I know, but when it really comes it's just hard to swallow. He is a great man, lived in Ely his whole life, his funeral service is in Ely too, a fitting place I'd say. 
system: Indeed, when will it be? 
user: It's held next week, haven't seen him in ages, can't believe our previous meeting was the last. 
system: Life is full of uncertainties, that's why they always tells us to live the moment.
