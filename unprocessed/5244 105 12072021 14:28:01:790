user: I had a really bad argument with my wife the other day and I feel very sorry. 
system: If you don't mind can I ask what was the argument about? 
user: Ah it is just one of those stupid little things you argue over and then it snowballs and things get out of hand. 
system: Do you feel that you are mainly responsible for the argument then? 
user: Well okay I did start it first, now I feel really guilty. 
system: Well if you are at fault then go apologise, get her a gift or something to make it up to her! 
user: After the argument she went back to her mother's home in Cambridge. She's not with me now. 
system: What are you waiting for? Christmas? Go and apologise for god's sake.
