user: That's good to hear. I just want this to go as smoothly as possible. Their kids are also coming along.
system: Don't worry! I'm pretty sure the kids will enjoy some TV on the train and you and your clients can treat yourself to some good dining onboard.
user: Great. I'm not really aware of any of them have any dietary restrictions. Maybe I should give them a call?
system: You could. But there are plenty of options for all types of foodies.
user: Nice! Maybe we can bring out the champagne once the deal is successful.
system: Well, you can't really give champagne to the kids. May I suggest fizzy apple juice for the young ones?
user: Hahaha, that's a clever trick! 
system: Good luck with your clients!
