user: Hey wait! I almost forgot. What was the other point of interest?
system: Oh right. There is an opera theatre nearby as well. But I would say it's not that great
user: How do you know?
system: Well looking at the number of negative reviews it received online, I would probably not recommend it.
user: Ah, I see. Well either way I'm not a huge opera fan. I just hope my guests have a good evening
system: That's understandable. After having a great time outside, your guests will be able to enjoy the comfort of 4-star hotel beds
user: That's good! A few good drinks after work should get us through the rest of the week! Much appreciated
system: Don't drink too much though! Hahaha
