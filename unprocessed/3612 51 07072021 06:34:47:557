user: My friend insisted that I meet her next week. 
system: I see that you two have some activities planned out? 
user: Not really! She really likes impromptu trips, and honestly I think that trips like these are more fun. Though, I'm not as daring as her. 
system: It seems that you are somewhat looking forward to the trip. 
user: I've never been to cambridge, so I'm excited but also nervous! 
system: I'm sure you two will figure it out.
