user: My family and I were thinking of taking a trip up there. 
system: Splendid. What's the occasion? 
user: Nothing special. The kid's summer break is coming up and we wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. 
system: Understandable. Sometimes all of us need a break. 
user: True. Do you think I could bring our dog along as well?  
system: I'm not sure. You can call the hotel to double confirm.  
user: Okay. I hope to bring the dog along as well. I don't want to leave him at the neighbours for too many days. 
system: Does the dog get agitated being away from its owner? Either way, I'm sure the hotel can answer any queries. 
user: Alright. Thanks again 
system: Have a great trip.
