user: Good morning, it has been a while since I had to go for a work trip.
system: That is indeed true, what is the plan going to be this time?
user: I'm still waiting for my boss's confirmation. But it is likely that I will be leaving Cambridge next week. From then on, it will be back to back conferences and training for me.
system: That sounds tiring. Can I do anything to help you out?
