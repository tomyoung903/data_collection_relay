user: Hi, I am planning my visit to England. I'm going to be there by 12 noon once my plane from Korea arrives
system: That's wonderful. Can I know more about what you would like to get from your trip?
user: Well I am currently a high school student. I am interested in going to Cambridge for my higher education. I have heard remarkable things from my parents' friends about it.
system: That is certainly true. It is a good place to study. It will also imbue you with an academic culture that is unique to it. 
user: Yes. I definitely intend to drop by to have a quick visit. However, I will not be staying anywhere near there so I would have to plan ahead.
system: Would you like some help in settling your transportation issues? I can also help you with planning other things that you may want to do once you're there.
