user: Drats! I can't believe my favourite team lost last night!
system: That is unfortunate! How was the match determined? 
user: My team was up by a goal up till the 70th minute before the opposition scored twice, it was so brutal!
system: Oh man, hope they will do better next time! 
user: They better do... I had a bet with my wife about who was going to win the match and she won... Now I will need to pay for our vacation trip! 
system: At least both of you will be enjoying yourselves! Have you made any plans? 
user: If I remember correctly, I think we have settled on Cambridge.
system: That sounds nice! I hope you two find something fun to do there!
