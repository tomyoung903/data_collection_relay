user: Hello there, I am from Singapore and I will be visiting Cambridge for a week in two months
system: Hi, is there anything you would like to know more about our city?
user: Yes actually. I would be interested in knowing about the colleges that are in the city. I have heard great things about them from my colleagues at home. I have also seen pictures of them online. They look so scenic.
system: Well, there are many that we have here. All of them are renowned schools and they each have their own feel. Many of them have origins dating all the way back to the 15th Century
user: I do not have a lot of time there unfortunately. I will only be there for a week and there are other places that I already have on my itinerary. It would be a shame however if I leave without having gone to any of them
system: In that case, are there any that you would like to visit in particular? We have a lot to visit and you would not have enough time to visit them all.
