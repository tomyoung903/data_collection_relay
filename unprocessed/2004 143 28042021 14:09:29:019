user: Nope. This will be my first time. I believe it will be nice. 
system: Of course. Indian food is so delicious and absolutely worth to try. 
user: I believe so. Will there be seats available during dinner time? What is your thoughts personally? 
system: Good question. But I believe it wouldn't be crowded. Because by common sense, people usually intend to have their dinner in the downtown, instead of near the college. 
user: Understood, thank you for your analysis. You are so smart. 
system: My pleasure. I am looking forward you to share with me how is the food there.
