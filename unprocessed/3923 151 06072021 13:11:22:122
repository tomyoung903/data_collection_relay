user: It's alright. I'm new here. 
system: That's nice. Where are you originally from? 
user: I'm from Leeds. I just finished University. I always wanted to go backpacking across the world. 
system: What brings you here? 
user: Well, Covid happened. So now I'm left with backpacking around my own country.  
system: How has it been going so far? 
user: Pretty good. A lot cheaper than going out of UK. Plus I haven't seen much of it either so it's welcome. 
system: Glad to hear that. Anything, in particular, you look for while travelling? 
user: I've always enjoyed art. But really I like broadening my horizons too. So I just try as much as I can. 
system: You'll definitely enjoy the theatre then.
