user: How do I make my vacation fun?
system: That's a tough one. I would say the best way would be to keep an open-mind, avoid conflict as much as possible, and leave all your emotional baggage at home.
user: I'll try. This is my first vacation in a while. I really want to enjoy it.
system: Great! It's a break well-deserved. Go and have fun!
user: You're awesome.
system: I feel the same about you!
