user: Oh god, I'm so sick of eating the street food at night markets! 
system: Well, why don't you try eating at a restaurant instead? 
user: Look, I'm on a trip to Bangkok with my parents. But they insist that we taste the authentic Thai food by eating at night markets and we've been having them every day!  
system: To be fair, you can have authentic Thai food in restaurants too! Maybe you can suggest that to your parents? 
user: True enough. I read online that there's this really good Thai cuisine restaurant, called Bangkok City! And I really wanna try it out! 
system: I would suggest that you bring your parents there for a treat! Hopefully, they'll like it!
