user: It is already autumn here in Ely. 
system: I'm listening. 
user: Before I realised I have already been here for 4 years. Incredible, felt like i have only arrived and moved in not long ago. 
system: Life is such, time slips us by before we realise. Seasons change, people come and go, and we complete this journey in the blink of an eye. 
user: You are making me sad. I think I'm gonna miss this place I have called home for 4 years. 
system: Why don't you stay here?
