user: I'm taking my kids to visit their grandparents this week. They’re really excited! 
system: That's lovely! 
user: Yeah! Too bad we’ll have to wait till their school break before we can go.  
system: Is that still very far off? 
user: Nope. Their last days are actually on this Wednesday, so we’ll be heading once their school ends.  
system: I hope all of you enjoy yourselves!
