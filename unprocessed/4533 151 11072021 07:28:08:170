user: Nice. I'm taking my extended family to a nice picnic. 
system: That's neat. What's the occasion? 
user: Everyone has summer holidays. So this is the best time to have any vacation together. 
system: You guys go for a picnic every summer holiday? 
user: Nope, not every. Sometimes the rest of us are busy with work. Or we just don't find the time. 
system: I see. Everyone was free this time? 
user: Yeah, why else would I be asking you for info? 
system: Fair enough. What do you guys do at your picnic? 
user: Depends. If it's a nice cool day we spend it outside talking and playing sports. At night, the adults have drinks together. Can't have kids involved in that, obviously. 
system: What about the kids? 
user: When they were little we would just let them sleep in their rooms. Now that they are older, as soon as we leave them alone for any period of time, they always create some nuisance. 
system: I'm sure you can distract them with Netflix or cartoons on the free wifi.
