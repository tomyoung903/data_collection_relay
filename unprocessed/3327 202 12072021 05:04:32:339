user: Is Chinese food good? My friends and I haven't tried it before. 
system: It depends on the person, but it should be a good experience. 
user: I hope you are right. Well, it's just a meal. 
system: Then have you and your friend tried Cuban food before? 
user: We had Cuban food the last time we went on a trip together and enjoyed it, so we wanted to have some Cuban food this time. 
system: I see, what a pity. But I believe the Chinese food won't be bad as well. 
user: I will know about it soon enough anyway. There's no harm trying, I guess. 
system: There's always a first for everything!
