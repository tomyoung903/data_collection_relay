user: Why do you think the weekend is on Saturday and Sunday only?
system: Maybe it's because two days of break is ideal with five days of work.
user: But who decided that it has to be on these two days? I think it makes sense to have one day of break in the middle of the week.
system: Is there anything stopping you from taking a break then?
user: I don't think so. Okay, now I really want to plan something fun for this Wednesday!
system: That's great, you're doing what you want to!
