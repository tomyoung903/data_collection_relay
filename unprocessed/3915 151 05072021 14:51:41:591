user: Sure, that'll do. My friend is house hunting around my area. 
system: That's nice. You are helping him find a home? 
user: No no, he has more qualified people to do that. I'm just helping him come over to check out the area. 
system: That's nice of you. How do you guys know each other? 
user: He's a friend from work. He stays on the other side, so for him it's been a pain to travel long distances, especially during Covid. 
system: Yeah, the pandemic has made a mess of everything. 
user: Sadly that's true. Either way, he wanted to help him find an initial place to stay. Not really sure what he wanted so I didn't know what to pick. 
system: I'm sure he will enjoy the comfort of a 4 star.
