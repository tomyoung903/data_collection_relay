user: I've had the worst week. Working from home is hell. 
system: Really? Some people prefer it to the office.
user: Not me. I need my peace and quiet. I would just take my laptop to the park and work there if I could.

user: That's true. I could spend the entire day outside. Thanks for the suggestion.
system: You're welcome.
