user: It's been such a bad day for me. 
system: Sorry to hear that, what has been going on? 
user: It was such a busy morning earlier, and I just lost my house keys. I still have plans somewhere later, so I need to make a police report now. 
system: Very sorry to hear your unfortunate circumstance, is there anything I can do to help?
