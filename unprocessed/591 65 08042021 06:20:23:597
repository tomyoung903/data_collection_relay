user: Good morning, it has been a while since I had to go for a work trip.
system: That is indeed true, what is the plan going to be this time?
user: Thanks for asking, I will be leaving Cambridge on Monday and I hope to reach my destination in about two hours. From then on, it will be back to back conferences and training for me.
system: That sounds tiring. Can I do anything to help you out
