user: Hey is it wrong to pass judgements about a person when you first meet them. 
system: I wouldn't say it is wrong but rather you should not be too trusting of your initial impression. 
user: Yeah but my girlfriend was so pissed when I told her it was love at first sight. 
system: I actually thought most people like that because it sounds rather romantic. 
user: That is what I thought as well but oh boy was I wrong, better make it up to her on Wednesday. 
system: Yeah sure, you should also grab a gift or something.
