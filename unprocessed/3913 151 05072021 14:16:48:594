user: I'm alright. My neighbour just hit my wife's car. 
system: Oh no. Any significant damage? 
user: A scraped bumper and a broken taillight but that's it. My wife is angry, however. 
system: Of course, she would be. Did the neighbour apologise? 
user: That's the thing. He didn't. 
system: Oh, dear. No wonder your wife is angry. 
user: Yeah. I'm trying to calm her down. I'm telling her and my neighbour we have the CCTV footage.  
system: Even with the footage, he isn't willing to back off? The audacity of this man. 
user: I'm just trying to keep the calm. My wife is pretty hot-headed. And my neighbour is lying badly. 
system: Get the police to sort this out.
