user: Alright, great. I'm meeting a few friends for a nature walk. 
system: Ah, I see. Are you a big fan of the outdoors? 
user: Yeah. I like how different and calm it is compared to the city. 
system: That's true. City's are quite busy. 
user: And packed with people. Whenever I take the Underground, I barely even have room to breathe. 
system: Oh, dear. This nature walk is a break from work then. 
user: Yeah. And also to catch up with a few friends. Been a while since we hung out together. 
system: Oh. Why is that? 
user: Covid put us all in lockdown. We all could barely go out. Now that the restrictions are eased and we can meet in groups, we are going to take advantage of it before it's too late again. 
system: I see. Should've guessed that. Anyways, enjoy your nature walk in the east.
