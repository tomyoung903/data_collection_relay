user: Good morning, it has been a while since I had to go for a work trip.
system: That is indeed true, what is the plan going to be this time?
user: Thanks for asking, I will be leaving Cambridge next week. From then on, it will be back to back conferences and training for me. To be frank, I'm not looking forward to it that much since these trips tend to drain the life out of me. However, duty calls!
system: That sounds tiring. Can I do anything to help you out?
