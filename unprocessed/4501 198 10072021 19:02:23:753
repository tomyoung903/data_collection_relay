system: Well, that's flattering. What do you have in plan for your getaway? I'm assuming with family? 
user: Yes, with family. We're celebrating my parents' anniversary.

user: Oh, no! Well, the 3 of us are going to have fun while our parents get some alone time together. 
system: Oh, that makes more sense!
