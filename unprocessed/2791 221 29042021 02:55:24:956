user: I'm excited for my stay. I wonder what these places have to offer.
system: I don't think the hotel will have much. Probably just the basics. Are you on a very tight budget?
user: That's fine, That's all I'm looking for. Not looking for too much. I'm actually going there to film a video!
system: Oh I see! That's interesting! Are you sure you're not looking for a better place?
user: Nope! I want to check out these places instead!
system: Okay then. All the best!
