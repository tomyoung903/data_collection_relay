user: Yeah, just a little shaken. Luckily it was only me in the car. 
system: Still, that is unfortunate. It's better that you head over to parkside station. Any major damage on the vehicle?

user: The bumper has come loose and there are a few scratches. I will probably have to take it servicing. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a look at the driver's face or the car number plate.
system: I'm sure the CCTV cameras at the police station would track it down
user: Hopefully. I wouldn't want my insurance agent to go crazy.
system: I'm sure it will be fine. Good luck!
