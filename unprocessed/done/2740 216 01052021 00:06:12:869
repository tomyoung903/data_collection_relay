user: It is so tiring planning for this trip, I need to consider so many things. 
system: Would you like to share with me? 
user: I am the only one planning and there are so many things to consider.
system: Did the other 7 people help you? It would be easier to plan together. 
user: I mean, I would say they tried, but they have differing opinions and I have to consider it too. 
system: I think you should talk it out with them, you will all be spending 2 days together too.
user: Hmm, I guess I will, thanks. I feel better letting it out.
system: Do not worry man! Do talk to me again when you need, I am always here for you.
