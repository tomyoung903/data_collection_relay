user: I am nervous for the outing. 
system: What's the occasion? A dinner with your family? 
user: A dinner with my own family would be less nerve-racking. I am bringing my boyfriend's family for a day out in the centre. 
system: Oh, that sounds tough. If it's any consolation, I'm sure the modern European food will impress them.  
user: I sure do hope so. It's my first time hanging out with them. 
system: Are you hanging out with them alone, without your boyfriend? 
user: Yes. They've never been to the centre so I decided I could at least do so. 
system: Oh, so you're taking a day off on Tuesday to hang out with them?  
user: Yes, my boyfriend would be working on that day so that's why he couldn't join us. 
system: You sound like the best future daughter-in-law!
