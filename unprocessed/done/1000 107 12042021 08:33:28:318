user: I took a train from the central station a few weeks ago. It was hell.
system: Oh? What happened?
user: It was so crowded. I got elbowed thrice. Next time, I'll be trying out the Birmingham new street station.
system: Oh. That's a newer location.
user: The station is smaller and kind of out of the way, but it's quite close to my house.
system: I see. Hopefully, it won't be too crowded.
