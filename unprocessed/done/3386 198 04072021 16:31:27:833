user: Yes. Please do. 
system: All done. Are you going on a solo trip? 
user: Yes, kind of. I'm meeting my friend there. 
system: Oh, is it a date? 
user: Not really, though I do wish it was. 
system: It sounds like the person you're meeting holds a significant importance in your life. 
user: How did you know? 
system: The fact that you're travelling all the way from Stansted to Cambridge to meet up with said person. On top of planning to book a restaurant, that is! 
user: Well, she's my best friend and I'm secretly in love with her. 
system: Oh, wow. Have you confessed your feelings yet? 
user: I'm planning to, on Thursday night. 
system: On the day you arrive at Cambridge? 
user: Yes. That is the day. 
system: Well, all the best! I hope the feeling's mutual.
