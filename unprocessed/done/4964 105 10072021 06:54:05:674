user: Time really flies. I have already been here in Cambridge for 3 years. 
system: Indeed it does, I hope you have had a great time so far and enjoy the remaining. 
user: Haha thanks. I think I will really miss this place when I am done, though it will probably take me a few more years. 
system: What are you doing here actually? 
user: I am here for my PhD, that is why it is such a long process, but I have enjoyed most of it. 
system: I see, must have taken you a while to adjust.
