user: Hello
system: Hello, how are you? Is there any way that I can help?
user: I'm doing good, weather's looking good today. I want to book an accommodation.
system: That's nice to hear! Okay, what kind of accommodation are you looking for?
user: How do I make my vacation fun?
system: That's a tough one. I would say the best way would be to keep an open-mind and avoid conflict as much as possible! Leave the emotional baggage at home.
user: I'll try
system: Great! Go and have fun.
