user: Well, I am from York. Anytime would be just fine. But I do prefer 9 in the morning. 
system: Done. A ticket from 9 a.m. has been booked. Are you going on a vacation by yourself? 
user: Thanks. Yes, I am going on a solo trip to rejuvenate myself. 
system: Wow, that sounds amazing. The 3 nights there will be the most relaxing thing ever. Will you be heading back to work on Monday? 
user: Yes. Just 3 days should be enough for me. Is it weird that I won't be able to relax if I spend any more days doing nothing but chill? 
system: Well, different people have different preferences. I'm sure you'll do just fine.  
user: Yes, at least I can say I know what I can handle. 
system: That's the spirit.
