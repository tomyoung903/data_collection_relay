user: Yes, I need a back up plan in case of bad weather. Do you have any suggestions that we can do? 
system: I would suggest simple games like charades. Without requiring many resources, all of you can take part in the game! One of you can act out the word while the others can guess the hidden word. 
user: Charades sounds like a good idea! But how do all of us play together when at least one of us have to create the keywords? 
system: Don't worry! There are premade word packs found on the internet so that all of you can take part in the game without spoiling the fun!
