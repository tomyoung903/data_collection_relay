user: I recently bought a guitar and I want to practice it so badly but I am quite busy lately. 
system: You can play the guitar at the hotel room if it's convenient for you. You can do it whenever you are free! 
user: I am still a beginner at this. I hope I can make some improvements! 
system: Practice makes perfect! I am sure you will get better over time! 
user: Thanks, I hope I don't disturb my neighbors with my bad guitar skills!  
system: I am sure you won't. Just make sure not to play it late at night in case your neighbors want to rest!
