user: My American friends are coming to visit this week.  
system: That’s great! Do you have anything planned? 
user: They asked me to give them a tour of London, but to be honest, I don’t really know what to do.  
system: Maybe just take them to popular tourist attractions? Or you could take them to places you like.  
user: That’s a great idea! The museums in London are amazing, I’ll take them to one! 
system: Glad I could help!
