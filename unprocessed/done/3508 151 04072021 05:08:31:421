user: I'm okay for now. We may have to leave our home for a while. 
system: All okay at home? 
user: Yeah mostly, but today morning the shower in our washroom broke and the roof started leaking in the living room. 
system: Oh no. Have you had it checked? 
user: Yeah, we called in a plumber. He said he's checking and his preliminary analysis says one of our main pipes had burst. 
system: That's terrible. 
user: And really expensive. We're going to have to move out for a while while he fixes it. 
system: Good thing you are only staying in a 3-star.
