user: I wanna go trip these days. Bro, do u have any plan recommend for me?
system: What a coincidence?! I also wanna go traveling during this week. Let me share my plan with you.
user: Wow, may be we can go together. 
system: Maybe :). You Can first find a hotel named "Cambridge Belfry". I have compared a lot during these days. Free-wifi and no worry about parking a car. 
user: Thankyou!! What would you do next?
system: Of course find some nice food haha. I have found one. I may direct you on that day. Its very simple if using a App named Grab to call a taxi.
