user: Yes please. I would like to get the most out of my visit there.
system: That's a great plan. The college will be teaching clay modelling in the Arts and Design block from 16:00-18:00 and will be hosting a seminar on second price auction theory in the auditorium at 19:00.
user: Wow! That's great. Are these free of charge to outsiders ?
system: The workshop charges outsiders $10 for the supplies, however, the seminar is free of charge for all. Would you like me to book you slots for both ?
user: Yes, that would be splendid. Thank you for the assistance.
system: No problem!
