user: Chinese food shouldn't be bad, am I right? 
system: It depends on the person, but it should be a good experience if you have not tried it before. 
user: I hope you are right. Well, it's just a meal. 
system: Then have you and your friend tried Cuban food before? 
user: We had Cuban food the last time we went on a trip together and enjoyed it, so we wanted to have some Cuban food this time. 
system: I see, what a pity. But I believe you and your friends will be able to enjoy some of the Chinese food too. 
user: I will know about it soon enough anyway. There's no harm trying, I guess. 
system: There's always a first for everything!
