user: Haha, my friends and I plan to shoot a video about the cheap hotel you just recommended. And we plan to start a youtube channel.
system: That's not a bad idea. Starting a youtube channel is not easy, you have to keep coming up with ideas for your videos. 
user: I know that, can i ask for your help if I ran out of ideas for my videos? Haha.
system: No problem my friend. I will sure give you the most interesting and enticing contents I could possibly think of.
