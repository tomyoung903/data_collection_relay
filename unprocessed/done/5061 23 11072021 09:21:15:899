user: I’ve just graduated from high school! 
system: Congrats! What are your plans now? 
user: I’m applying to college! Though I haven’t decided which one to go to yet.  
system: Then you’d better get researching! 
user: Actually, my mom suggested I visit the colleges in person first. She’s said it’s be better if I got a feel of each of them before deciding.  
system: That’s a good idea. You still have a lot of time left before the application period closes. Might as well check them out in person.  
user: Yeah I thought so too, so I gathered some friends to go check out colleges with.  
system: Nice! Maybe some of you will even end up in the same college.
