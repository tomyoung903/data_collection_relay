user: I'm hungry.
system: Why don't you go get some food?
user: I'm too lazy to get out of bed.
system: Unfortunately, I can't help you out if you can't get out of bed. Why don't you order delivery?
user: Delivery uses too much plastic! I might take a taxi instead to the good luck chinese food takeaway. I loved their dimsum!
system: That's true, there has been too much plastic wastes in landfills. Yes their dim sum is the best! How can I assist you?
