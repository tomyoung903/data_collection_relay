user: I am thinking of what birthday gift I can give him. I am out of ideas. 
system: I recommend that you can get him a birthday cake for his birthday! You can cut and eat the cake at the restaurant too! I am sure they won't mind! 
user: I hope so, it can be a surprise for him too. 
system: You can sing a birthday song for him too. I am sure he will be blessed!  
user: I must remember to get some candles from the cake shop. 
system: Make sure to get him to make a wish before he cut the cake!
