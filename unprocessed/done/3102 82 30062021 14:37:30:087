user: Hey! I recently started a dance club in my school and I am so excited about it. 
system: Wow! How is it going? 
user: I already have 7 members but we barely know each other. 
system: I guess that can be fixed when you spend more time together. 
user: Yeah I want to plan some activities for the group to bond better away from the city of cambridge. 
system: Sounds like a great plan!
