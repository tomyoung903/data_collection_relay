user: Alright. My friends and I are watching a football match live over the weekend. 
system: Nice. Who's playing who? 
user: Cambridge United vs Broxbourne Borough. I'm really excited. I have never watched a FA Cup match live before. 
system: Sounds great.  
user: Yeah. Luckily one of my mates knows someone on the stadium board, so he was able to get us all access VIP passes.  
system: Wow. What does that get you? 
user: A lot in fact. Sponsor events, shirts signed by team captains, photoshoots, and even private tours around the stadium. 
system: Damn, sounds intense. Hopefully, 2 nights is enough. 
user: I doubt it will be. But I will take what I get. 
system: That's the best we can do.
