user: This is the worst Valentine's Day ever! My girlfriend dumped me! 
system: Oh, such bad news. Did she mention the reason? 
user: No! She got angry all of a sudden... 
system: People's temper is always like this, comes suddenly and goes suddenly as well. 
user: Yes, so I am trying to restore our relationship. Maybe ask her to see a movie, at least figure out the reason why I am dumped. 
system: I am sure it's a good idea. All shall be well.
