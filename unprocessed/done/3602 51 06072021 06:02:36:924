user: Today has gone pretty badly for us. 
system: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? 
user: The hotel we're supposed to stay in informed us that our booking has been invalidated. To make things worse, I haven't received a refund yet, how irresponsible! 
system: That seems unfair, I'm sorry that you have encountered an inconvenience like this. 
user: We're forced to change our plans. Fortunately, there's a few places here at Leicester to stay at, but we'll have to leave after a couple of nights. 
system: I see.
