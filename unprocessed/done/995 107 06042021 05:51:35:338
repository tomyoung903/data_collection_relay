user: Steve mentioned I might be in the running for a big promotion at work.
system: That's amazing! Do you know who you're up against?
user: No idea. They're all my friends anyway, so it's better not to know. I might end up resenting them.
system: That's true. Do you have a good feeling about the promotion?
user: Yes. I'm speaking at a conference in Cambridge soon. If I impress them, I'm sure I'll get it.
system: Wow! Best of luck with your speech.
