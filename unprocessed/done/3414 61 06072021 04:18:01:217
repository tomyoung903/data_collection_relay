user: My landlord will only give me access to the Internet next week.  
system: Oops, hope you have enough mobile data.

system: No worries, many other things are there to make your life interesting.  
user: Yep, that's what I am thinking. I will call my friends to have fun together.  
system: That sounds great. Friends are more important than the Internet.
