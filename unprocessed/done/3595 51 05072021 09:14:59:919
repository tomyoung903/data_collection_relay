user: Hi, how would you plan a really exciting night for your parents' anniversary? 
system: I'm a virtual assistant, so I don't have parents. I can't answer that question. 
user: Sorry, it's just that my sisters and I are struggling to come up with something for our parents. Their 40 years marriage anniversary is coming soon. 
system: Congratulations to your parents! Is there a meaningful memory for them that you can help recreate? 
user: They went punting for their first date, so maybe boats will be a significant thing to add to our itinerary. Thanks for the idea! 
system: Glad that I could help, I hope that your parents will enjoy their upcoming anniversary.
