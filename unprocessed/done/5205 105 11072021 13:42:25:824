user: Is it just me or is it getting hotter and hotter these days. 
system: Well the fact that you are saying this shows that global warming is very real. 
user: Yeah I don't doubt it. Climate has changed a lot since when I was a kid here in Cambridge. 
system: How was it like back in those days? 
user: I mean it was fabulous but it wasn't this hot, nowadays it is hot to the point that you can get a heatstroke from just being outside. 
system: Gosh that sounds terrible, but people will just stay indoors and turn on aircon and worsen the situation.
