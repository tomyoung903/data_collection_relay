user: I am bringing my children along, does the hotel has a kid-friendly environment?
system: May I know how old are your children?
user: The older one is 8 years old and the younger one is 7 years old.
system: Internet coverage via Wi-Fi is being covered in the hotel, your children would be entertained with using of their mobile phones.
user: If that’s the case, I wouldn’t need to organize this family trip. I wanted a trip to bond the family together.
system: You can bring board games to play as a family. 
user: Then I wouldn’t have to go on a family trip. 
system: 
I beg to differ, being on a vacation enable every one of you to disconnect from the world and reconnect with the people you are with. Besides when you look back many years later, what matters when having a family vacation isn’t about where you are or what you do, but rather, who you are with and the memories that you have done with them.
user: Alright then, I will take on your suggestion. Please help me book the hotel. Thank you!
system: Sure, I will do as instructed!
