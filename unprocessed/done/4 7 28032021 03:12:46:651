user: My sister is celebrating her birthday next weekend and I need to meet her in South Hall before Saturday
system: That is nice. I hope you have fun
user: I think I will drive to meet her. How is the traffic on the road on weekends from here to South Hall?
system: The traffic is usually very heavy during the weekends and it would like you about 2 hours to reach there, if you drive.
