user: Hey if I want to ask for a random girl's number, is that acceptable behaviour 
system: I think that really depends on which country and where that girl is from. 
user: I am at the london kings cross, and there is this really cute girl. 
system: Well I don't see why not then, you probably won't meet her again. 
user: NEVERMIND.... I think her boyfriend just appeared. 
system: Oops, I am so sorry to hear that.
