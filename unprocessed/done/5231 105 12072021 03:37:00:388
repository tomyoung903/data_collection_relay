user: Hahaha my mom tried really hard to make me sporty when I was young! 
system: What kind of stories did you tell you? Would you mind sharing? 
user: She said that she used to lure me with candies to go out and play sports, and she spent hundreds of thousands to buy all kind of new equipments for me! 
system: Wow and did that work out for her? 
user: Not at all, I became an arts person instead, locking myself up in the room for all kind of arts stuff. 
system: Wow she must be really disappointed, but this sounds like a great case study of nature vs nurture. 
user: Absolutely! For some reason I am just really into architectures since young and no one ever exposed me to them it was just like an instinct. 
system: Wow! And is that what you plan to pursue as a career next time?
