user: It's alright. My family and I are celebrating thanksgiving different this year. 
system: I see. What do you guys usually do on thanksgiving then?  
user: Get together, cook a turkey and enjoy a few drinks with the family members. 
system: Sounds interesting. Why did you guys decide to shake it up this year? 
user: I guess we're all tired of the same routine for the past few years so we wanted to try something new. 
system: I see. Do you guys meet each other often or is it mostly thanksgiving? 
user: Mostly on the big holidays when everyone is free. Everyone is always busy on other days. 
system: Understandable.  
user: Yeah. We want to make it different this year and have a big splash. 
system: Good thing you are having expensive cuisine then.
