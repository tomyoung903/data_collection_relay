user: My parents are planning to repaint their home this weekend. They needed a place to stay over for a few days.
system: Oh okay. Why not let them stay over at your home? 
user: I would if they agreed to it. But they'd rather not move too far and disturb my family and me. They suggested getting a hotel room instead. I hope they don't bore themselves out.
system: Understandable. They will able to watch as many shows as they want with free wifi.
user: That's true. But they are not exactly tech-savvy people. They will probably just watch whatever is on TV. I just want them to sleep comfortably.
system: Ah, I see. I'm sure that your parents will enjoy the luxury amenities available.
