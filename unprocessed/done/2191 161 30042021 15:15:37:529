user: After a long week, I just want to be able to treat myself...
system: Yes I understand. I think steak at the Cambridge Chop House would be a good treat for yourself. Heard their wine selection is amazing too.
user: I'm not about to engage in a midday drinking session.
system: I'm sorry. Sure there are other ways to relax after a hectic week.
user: Yeah I hope the steak is good. Thanks for the suggestion.
system: You are welcome. All the best for this week.
