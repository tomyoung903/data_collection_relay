user: My boss is killing me with all the work she's giving me ! 
system: Sounds like you have a difficult boss. 
user: Totally. She's the type to call me up for overtime over the weekends on short notice too. 
system: That's rough. My condolences to you. 
user: I think she's planning to call me back this Saturday too. I will not let her take my weekend this time. 
system: How are you planning to do that ?
