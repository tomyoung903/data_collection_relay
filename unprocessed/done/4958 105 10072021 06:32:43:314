system: Oh man, don't be too beat up about it, it's just a test. 
user: Indeed but my mom is going to kill me, she's a history teacher. 
system: Oops, I hope you are mentally prepared to face a storm in that case. 
user: Maybe I should head to the museum and get some souvenirs  for her so that she will feel bad if she's too harsh 
system: Haha you could do that! Do you know what she likes.
