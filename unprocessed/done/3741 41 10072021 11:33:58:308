user: I'm finally returning from my month-long business trip to Singapore. 
system: That's a really long trip. You must be feeling homesick. 
user: Well, I've gotten used to it by now. Since my business is based there, I've had to head down frequently to keep an eye on things. 
system: I see. I've heard that Singapore is a wonderful country. 
user: It's sure is! Not only is the infrastructure exceptional, but the services and entertainment are excellent as well. 
system: Ever considered moving there? Perhaps it would be more convenient for managing your business. 
user: Good old cambridge might be lacking in some areas, but having lived here my whole life, there is definitely a sense of attachment.
