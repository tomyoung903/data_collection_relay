user: Sure, that will do. Some of my Chinese buddies are coming over to meet me this summer. 
system: That's great. How far back do you guys go? 
user: About 3 years. I was headhunted by a big Chinese firm at that point of time. 
system: Oh that's nice. What happened? 
user: Nothing haha. I just did my job and apparently, I did it well as they asked me to head their European branch. 
system: That's great. You must be happy to meet your colleagues. 
user: I am. They were such great hosts when I arrived there. Always helping and looking out for me, translating Mandarin to English as required. 
system: You are lucky to have friends like that. 
user: I am. I want to be a gracious host too and impress them when they finally arrive. I hope I do well. 
system: Don't worry. I'm sure they'll be touched by you picking out something from their culture. Expensive food won't be bad.
