user: Is Sunday a good day to go out?
system: Yes it certainly is, it is the weekends and family day is on Sunday.
user: What will you recommend to do on Sundays then?
system: For outdoor activities, you can opt to go for a hike, or a swim at the swimming pool near your house. If you prefer indoors, then I'd suggest a book together with a cup of coffee, or watching a television series.
user: I am more of an outdoor person, may I know where can I go hiking then?
system: It depends on your current location!
