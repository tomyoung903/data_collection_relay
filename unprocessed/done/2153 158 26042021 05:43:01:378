user: I wanna have fun in the east. Do u have any suggestions?
system: Err... I used to go to Cherry Hinton Hall and swam there.
user: Okay, that sounds not bad. Btw, is there a free car park?
system: No. These year is becoming harder and harder to find a place where you dont have to pay. 
user: Uhhh, thankyou. See you. 
system: Bye :)
