user: I'm planning to take my kids on a nice trip. 
system: That's nice. Is it just you and the kids? 
user: Yeap. My wife is away at work. So it's just us. 
system: Alright. Is there any reason for your trip? 
user: Nah. Just a weekend getaway. 
system: I see. Good to spend more time with your kids. 
user: Yeah. I don't want to leave them at home. They will just be sitting on their phones.  
system: It's good to get them out to museums.
