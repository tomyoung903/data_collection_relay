user: Are there walk-ins? Everyone is really looking forward to this but we have no time to book because the trip is so impromptu that we haven't even started packing. 
system: Wow! Impromptu trips are always the best. Anyway, there are strictly no walk-ins. Seeing how stressed out you seem, I can book the hotel for you, it'll only take a minute. 
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
