user: I don't think I need anything else. My sister just flew in from Canada and is residing there for now. 
system: That's nice. Are you guys going to meet up? 
user: Yep. She was supposed to fly over last week but got delayed due to a work conflict. 
system: Ah, I see. What brings her over here? 
user: Just visiting the family. We all live here. She lives in a different country. 
system: Why is that? 
user: She went over for her Master's. Eventually, she found some Canadian dude she liked and they got married.  
system: Aww, that's very sweet. Did she come over alone or with her husband as well? 
user: With her husband as well. No kids yet. They are deciding to wait.  
system: Understandable.  
user: Yeah. It's so expensive to raise kids now. Anyways, I need to go pick them up for tonight's family dinner over at mum's. I hope I find them. Haven't been to that area. 
system: Don't worry. You will find Hobson's.
