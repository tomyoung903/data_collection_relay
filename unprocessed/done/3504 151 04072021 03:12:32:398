user: I'm good. My Hall committee in my university had planned a bonding session for the new committee members. 
system: Okay. So? 
user: I'm part of the new committee. I was really looking forward to spending time with my new buddies. But my boss at work had other ideas. 
system: Oh, what happened? 
user: He wants me to meet a client on the same day. He said it will be a good experience. As an intern, it will be my first client meeting. 
system: Are you nervous about the meeting? 
user: A little. I'm more scared that the meeting will take too long and I will be too tired to hang out with my committee members later in the evening. 
system: Oh. Is it viable for you to shorten the meeting time? 
user: I could. That's why I'm departing early. So I can get prepped earlier and give the client the low down asap. But whenever I do anything intensive early in the day, I get too tired to stay up late at night. 
system: Don't worry. If you can finish the meeting early, you can rest in the city hotel before your buddies arrive.
