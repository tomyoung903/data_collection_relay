user: I received a package for the virtual reality headset that I ordered. 
system: That is quite fancy! You will need a powerful computer to power it though. 
user: I have a powerful enough computer to run virtual reality. I just need to clear out some space in my apartment so I don't crash into stuff while using virtual reality. I heard some people have injured themselves because they didn't do that. But since there is no rush I am going to do it later. 
system: I hope you enjoy your new device! 
user: I will be going to ruskin gallery tomorrow to take a relaxing walk through. 
system: I hope you enjoy your time there, the art at that museum is good.
