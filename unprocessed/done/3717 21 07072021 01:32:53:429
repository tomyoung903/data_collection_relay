user: I scored good marks in my A-levels!  
system: Congratulations! Many opportunities await you in the next stage for your academic journey! 
user: Time for me to find a college that is good for me. I don't want to pick one that is far away, I learnt my lesson from picking a good but faraway for my previous school. The travel times and costs were too much for my liking. 
system: Remember to choose carefully which one you want to go to. Don't disregard other aspects of a school just because of its proximity.
