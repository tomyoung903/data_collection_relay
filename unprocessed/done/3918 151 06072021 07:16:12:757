user: Great. My wife and I are having the home repainted. 
system: Why is that? 
user: We just bought the home. The previous owner had 2 kids who sort of ran rampant on the walls. 
system: Oh, dear. Is it very bad? 
user: No actually. It's quite cute. But my wife fancies herself as an interior designer so ever since she's moved in she's been pestering me to call the painters. 
system: You are not happy to paint up the walls? 
user: Not really. It's just that the home, even with its drawn walls was amazing. It was out of our budget, however. 
system: Yet you guys still bought it? 
user: It was too good a deal for us to turn it down. Luckily the bank approved our loan. But at the end of the day, I like planning things. 
system: So buying something out of budget ruined the plan? 
user: More or less. I like a structure. My wife is more spontaneous. I agree the deal was way too good to pass on but at the end of the day still out of our budget. We need to save up money. Repainting the walls isn't cheap. 
system: No wonder you were searching for cheaper accomodations.
