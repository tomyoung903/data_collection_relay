user: Do you happen to have a favourite season of the year? 
system: Well if I had to choose I'd say summer. 
user: Why summer of all the seasons? 
system: Well I am not a big fan of the cold, so summer is just much more viable for me. 
user: I see, maybe that is because you haven't experience summer here in bishops stortford. 
system: Is summer the worst season of all for you then? 
user: Yes because every other season, it is rather bearable, but summer is just so hot and you can't strip naked on the streets and you just have to tolerate the heat. Honestly the worst. 
system: Wow that is actually something I have not considered, winter is cold but you need more clothes, but you can't go without anything during summer.
