user: It is a mix of a travel and food blog. I just started writing it last month. Do you have any suggestions for what food I should try out next? I have written about Italian food already.
system: That sounds interesting. There are many kinds of food, such as Mexican, Korean and Greek ones, to try out.
user: Maybe I will go for Mexican-styled food next!
system: Burritos are my personal favorite. Do try it out if you haven't.
