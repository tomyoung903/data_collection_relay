user: Actually, do you think going to the museum alone is a good idea?
system: Why not? I think that surrounding yourself with artwork while alone allows you to be fully immersed.
user: You are right. I was actually thinking if I should look for a travel companion.
system: I believe having some time just for yourself is good too, but up to you if you want to travel with a stranger.
user: Hmm. You know what? I'll just stick to my plan of going alone.
system: Sounds good! Hope you enjoy yourself during the trip.
