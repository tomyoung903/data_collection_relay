user: I'm meeting my pen pal from Italy for the first time. I hope she likes the food here. 
system: I think she will be pleased with the Italian restaurant. The food shouldn't be too bad. 
user: I hope so. I want her to enjoy herself since she travelled far just to visit us. 
system: Even if the food is not exactly the same as the ones served in Italy, I'm sure she can appreciate how differently food is prepared here. 
user: You might be right. She's someone who likes to try new things after all.  
system: Don't worry too much and enjoy yourselves! It is your first time meeting her in person so do take the opportunity to get to know her well.
