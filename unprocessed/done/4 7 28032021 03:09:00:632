user: My sister is celebrating her birthday next weekend and I need to meet her in South Hall before Saturday
system: That is nice. I hope you have fun
user: I think I will drive to meet her. How is the traffic on the road on weekends from here to South Hall?
system: It is rush hour on Saturday so if you drive, it will take 20 minutes. Would you prefer driving or taking public transport?
