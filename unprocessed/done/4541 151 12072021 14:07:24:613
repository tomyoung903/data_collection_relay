user: I lost a bet. 
system: Oh, what happened? 
user: I bet that England would win the Euros. But Italy won. 
system: Hahah. So what does that entail? 
user: I have to buy dinner for everyone. 
system: Ah, that doesn't seem too bad. 
user: Yeah, it probably isn't. Just don't like losing a bet though.

system: Shouldn't have bet against so many people then.
