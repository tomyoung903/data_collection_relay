user: I think I messed up my interview. 
system: Why do you think that? 
user: I couldn't answer most of his questions, was consistently stuttering and nervous. I am so sad. 
system: I'm so sorry to hear that. Take your time to get over it, and I am sure you will learn a lot to do better at the next one. 
user: Thanks, I just can't believe I came all the way to Cambridge to mess up so bad, I want to go back home and just escape for a little bit. 
system: It's ok. It is the learning that matters, just don't make the same mistakes again.
