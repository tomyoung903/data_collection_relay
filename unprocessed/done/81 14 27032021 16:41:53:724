user: Planning for a trip always stresses me out.
system: That's not good. A trip should be enjoyable. Let me help you. 
user: That's a great idea. I take forever to figure these things out on my own. 
system: Lucky for you, I'm great at planning. Just tell me what you need. 
user: I'll be ready once I get a train. Should probably get to that soon.
system: I can help you right now. That's not difficult at all. I'd need some details though ...
