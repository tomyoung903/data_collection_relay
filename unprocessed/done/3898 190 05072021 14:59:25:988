user: My kid always wanted to watch a live performance for a very long time. 
system: You can definitely bring him to the art theatre. It provides significant educational benefits, including high levels or tolerance! 
user: Yeah, we have always been watching but from our television instead. 
system: Watching from the television does not have the same intimacy of sense of participation. Being able to share experience with live audience is very valuable!

system: I am sure he will! I hope he will take a lot of knowledge away from this. It will be beneficial for his growth!
