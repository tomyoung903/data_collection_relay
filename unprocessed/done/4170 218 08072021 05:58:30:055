user: I am going to investigate a criminal case at that place. 
system: Wow, that sounds interesting. Maybe renting a car there will improve your efficiency in doing your job. 
user: Yes, of course. I need to collect all the evidence there in order to accuse the suspect. 
system: Maybe you can try to cooperate with the local police force. 
user: I don't think I will need to cooperate with them. I will do this on my own. 
system: I believe you can settle this on your own!
