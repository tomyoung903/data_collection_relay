user: Did you know, there's a new style of conducting business meetings now where people just go for a walk?
system: Really? Sounds interesting.
user: It sounds too informal. Still, it has my boss hooked. He wants the whole team to go a park later today.

system: You might change your mind. They're refreshing.
