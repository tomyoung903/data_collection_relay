user: Ah damn, I'm supposed to go on a date with my girlfriend tomorrow, but I haven't even decided on where to bring her! 
system: Hmm, maybe a cinema to catch a movie? Or even a theatre! 
user: Nah, I've brought her to those places so many times! Oh! I remember! She has been really into artworks and antiques lately! 
system: Well, you should bring her to a gallery! I'm sure she'll like it! 
user: How did I not think of that! My friend mentioned that this attraction called Williams Art and Antiques is really cool! 
system: Then you should go ahead and bring her there!
