user: We are not just allowed to dine for 15 minutes right? That is too short!
system: Oh no no no, that is not what I meant! Allow me to rephrase, try to get to the restaurant by 18:15, else we will have to give your table to other waiting customers. Have to take care of our customers that are queuing physically in front of the restaurant as well right!
user: Oh, I see. Another question, is there any way of going around the area? Just in case I have travel plans, you know when I want to walk around and do something instead of staying in for the whole period. It would be quite boring. 
system: No worries! You can always use ride-hailing apps with the free wifi!
