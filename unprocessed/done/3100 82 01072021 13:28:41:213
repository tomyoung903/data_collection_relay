user: I couldn't read what the teacher was writing on the board today during math class.  
system: Oh no! What happened? 
user: I went to the doctor and it turns out I need glasses.  
system: What was the doctor like? 
user: She was a little impatient and rude but really smart. I really don't want to wear glasses.  
system: I think glasses make people look really smart. Also, I hope you don't fall behind in your math class. 
user: Oh that's fine I asked someone for notes.  
system: I hope they are helpful! You can always ask the professor if you have any doubts. Where are you going to go for glasses? 
user: My friend owns a store in Cambridge and I think he might give me a discount. 
system: That's what good friends are for!
