user: Really good sauteed mushrooms. I just had it at the Dojo Noodle bar just now. 
system: There are a number of positive reviews for said bar. I'm glad you've enjoyed the place.
user: I'm still there. But I have to go to work soon.
system: A night shift? I hope you've either had a good amount of sleep or a good amount of coffee.
