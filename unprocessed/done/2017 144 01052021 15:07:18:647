user: We are not just allowed to dine for 15 minutes right? That is too short!
system: Oh no no no, that is not what I meant! Just try to arrive as early as possible (before a quarter of an hour after your reservation time), else your reservation slot will be retracted. See you there!
user: Oh, I see. Another question, is there any way of going around the area? Just in case I have travel plans, you know when I want to walk around and do something instead of staying in for the whole period. It would be quite boring. 
system: No worries! You can always use ride-hailing apps with the free wifi!
