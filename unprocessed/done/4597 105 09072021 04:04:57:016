user: Colleges are so overrated. 
system: What makes you say that? Did someone offend you? 
user: No but I have never gone to college but now I am winning in life. 
system: I mean it is a factor but it's not the deciding factor for one's success in life. 
user: Yeah then what's the point if it is not the deciding factor. 
system: I am sure you get many other things out of it, connections, knowledge etc and these aren't measured by success.
