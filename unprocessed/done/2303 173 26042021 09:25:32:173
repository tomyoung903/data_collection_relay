user: I was at a loss. Thank you for the advice. I don't know good places for car repair. Just a note: there are obvious dents on the car trunk. My car can still drive, don't need a tow truck. 
system: You could drive by authorised car repair workshops around the vicinity.  You could try German Tech Cars Cambridge Ltd, National Tyres and Autocare. 
user: Appreciate the informative suggestion. I would not have gotten this far without your advice.
system: My pleasure. Please take a good break after this.
