user: I was at a loss. Thank you for the advice. I don't know good places for car repair. Just a note: there are obvious dents on the car trunk. My car can still drive, don't need a tow truck. 
system: You could still call for a tow truck if you have collision insurance that can cover the cost. Otherwise, you could drive by authorised car repair workshops around the vicinity.  You could try German Tech Cars Cambridge Ltd at 50 Clifton Rd or National Tyres and Autocare. They are near your area.
user: Appreciate the informative suggestion. I would not have gotten this far without your advice.
system: Not a problem, I am glad to help. Please take a good break after the issue has been settled
