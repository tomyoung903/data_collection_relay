user: My friends and I had a really funny conversation yesterday. 
system: What was so funny about it? 
user: They teased me for not being cultured enough! Do I look like someone who doesn't appreciate the arts? 
system: Unfortunately, I can't answer that question. 
user: In response, I suggested for us to get away from the neighbourhood for the weekend. 
system: Why did you suggest that? 
user: There's not a lot of interesting places here really. Cambridge is home to a vibrant arts scene, so why not show them I can just be as cultured too? 
system: I see.
