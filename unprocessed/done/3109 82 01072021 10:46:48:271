user: I love flying on airplanes. It's my favourite mode of transport. 
system: Same here! What do you like about it? 
user: I like being at the same level as the clouds, looking at the world from above. It's like a completely different world. 
system: I never thought of it that way. For me it is the food. Most people don't like airplane food but I find it delicious. I know that's weird. 
user: That is very weird. Last time I flew to stansted airport I slept through most of the flight because I wanted to avoid the food. 
system: I usually watch a lot of movies on my flights.
