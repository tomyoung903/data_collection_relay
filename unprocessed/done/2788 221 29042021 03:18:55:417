user: The journey is kind of long. I should bring along some form of entertainment right?
system: That's a good idea! Maybe you could download a movie to watch on your ride there? 
user: Sounds like a plan! Any other suggestions perhaps? I'm afraid I will get motion sickness.
system: If you have motion sickness, I would recommend taking a nap instead. he train ride is indeed rather long. 
user: I was considering that as well. Thanks bro.
system: No worries! You might want to bring along motion sickness pills too!
