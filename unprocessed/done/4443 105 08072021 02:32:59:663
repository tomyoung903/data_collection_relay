user: My girlfriend's mother just invited me to their house for a family dinner. 
system: Congrats aye! It is a step in the right direction, a sign of recognition! 
user: HAHHAHA hopefully, but I am worried I will mess it up. 
system: Well just be mindful of your disposition and bring gifts, that  will leave a good impression. When is it? 
user: It is next week! I am currently in Peterborough and I have to travel to their place, not sure where I should buy the gifts. 
system: If you find something suitable then get it, don't wait till the last minute.
