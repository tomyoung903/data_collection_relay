user: Thanks. My wife is Indian and she loves spicy food! I should probably take her to a place that offers spicy options.
system: Maybe you can roam around to find more restaurants and attractions after your meal. I am sure you could find someplace with spicy options of her choice!

user: Hmm. I am looking forward to it! Thanks for your suggestion. Do you think I should take my children along? They prefer something more bland to eat.
system: I am sure a restaurant would have different options to satiate a variety of customers. If not, your children might enjoy trying something different!
