user: My friend thinks I am uncultured. 
system: Why is he so mean? On the bright side at least he is honest about his thoughts. 
user: I don't know but I feel insulted, we were at an exhibition and I knew nothing about the artifacts on display. 
system: Well maybe you should broaden your knowledge as well to prove him wrong! 
user: Right, maybe I should go to museums more and destroy him the next time I see him. 
system: Well it is always about improving yourself, so I'd say go for it!
