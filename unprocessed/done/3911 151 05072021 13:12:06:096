user: It's alright. There's been a leak at the local oprphanage. 
system: Oh no. What kind of leak? 
user: Their main water pipe burst today. They had to call in the municipal department 
system: How terrible. Are the kids alright? 
user: Yeah. Those little boys and girls seemed to enjoy seeing the fountain of water gushing out of their backyard. 
system: Such innocent minds. 
user: They might be innocent but that didn't stop the fact that the very fountain they were celebrating caused them to lose water supply to their building? 
system: Oh no. What happens now? 
user: Some of the parents are getting together to deliver some food to the little ones. Me and the others are trying to find places for them to stay. 
system: That's very sweet of you guys. 
user: I hope so. Breaks my heart to see such little kids without any parents. They were so frightened when they were told that they would have to move. We all need to them distract them as much as possible. 
system: Don't worry. You guys are doing a great job. Give them a good meal and let them watch Netflix on the free wifi and they'll be alright.
