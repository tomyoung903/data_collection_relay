user: My friend is a huge fan of theatre and he recommended this theatre to me the other day. 
system: Are you into it as well? 
user: Yes though certainly not as fervent as him, I don't know if I should really visit or not though. 
system: What are the factors holding you back? 
user: It is really out of my way if I want to go to the theatre because it is actually in Cambridge and not the town I am in. 
system: Well if you want to make it worthwhile, you could spend a few more days in town.
