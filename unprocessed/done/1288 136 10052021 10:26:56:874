user: I don't think it is a good idea for me to have Indian cuisine during my stay.
system: Why is that so?
user: I have an important interview after lunch, but I get the runs whenever I eat Indian food.
system: Oh no that doesn't sound good. There are other places to eat at other than the indian foodplace. Why not eat else where? There are many places to eat near the east of town after all.
user: I will feel calmer if I eat something familiar.
system: Some stomach medicine might help with digestion if you insist on eating Indian food.
user: That's a good idea!
system: Take care of your health and good luck for your interview!
