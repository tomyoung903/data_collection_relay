user: I have been craving Indian cuisine recently but I don't think it's a good idea to have during my stay.
system: Why is that so?
user: I always get the runs after having it. It would be very annoying since I have a meeting with a client in Cambridge.
system: Is it a must to have indian food then? Why not eat something else to be safe?
