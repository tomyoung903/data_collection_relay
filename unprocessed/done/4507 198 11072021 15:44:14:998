user: That is all. Does hanging out at museums sound fun and exciting? 
system: Yes, of course! But I have to say, to each their own. Everyone has different interests. 
user: You're right, I have to agree. I'm just worried because my friends told me I'm not "fun and exciting" enough. I'm bringing them to the museums to prove them wrong. 
system: Ouch, that sucks. The 2 of them sound like terrible friends!  
user: That's true. But they're not usually that mean. It's a stressful period for us all. 
system: I understand. Hope Sunday goes well for you.
