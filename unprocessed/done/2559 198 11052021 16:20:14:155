user: Do you think my daughter will like the plan?
system: Is she a big fan of museums or art in general?
user: I'm not too sure. I haven't met her in a long time. 
system: Oh no, what happened?
user: Her mother and I are divorced. She's been living her mother ever since 5 years ago. 
system: Have you visited her since 5 years ago?
user: I did several times, but the last time I did was a year ago. I am planning to bring her to the museum and treat her to an expensive dinner. 
system: Well, kudos for the effort. Why did you reserve a table for 8 though?
user: I am planning to introduce her to my new family. I had a remarriage. But my current wife already has 3 kids from her previous marriage and we are bringing my wife's parents along as well. 
system: Wow, that sounds overwhelming.
user: Is that bad? I am afraid I'll scare her away.
system: Well, you should make sure that she is heard and that her needs are met. Does she even like Italian food?
user: Yes, I am very sure about that.
system: Then that's a good first step.
