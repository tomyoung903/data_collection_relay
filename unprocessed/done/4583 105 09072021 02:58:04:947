user: Do you think colleges play a big part in one's career. 
system: Well I'd say that it is more important early career, but probably not so much mid or late-career. 
user: I agree. I have never been to college and honestly it was really hard going around without a degree at first. But after a few years of work it doesn't really matter anymore. 
system: Right. Cause over the years the work experience you have becomes much more important and valuable.
