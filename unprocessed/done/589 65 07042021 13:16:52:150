user: Hi, life's been so tiring. I really can't wait for my next trip out of the city. I hear that taking days off is a good way to de-stress.
system: That sounds wonderful, are you going somewhere far away?
user: No, I won't. I'm planning to go to Broxbourne. I hear that they will be having this wonderful museum exhibit for a few weeks. I can't wait to see all the art while sipping on a good cup of coffee.
system: Sounds great to me!! I hope you will be able to relax. Is there anything else?
