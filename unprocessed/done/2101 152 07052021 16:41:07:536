user: Alright. I wanted to try a new cuisine, so I'm a little disappointed.
system: I understand. The Caribbean cuisine is indeed an interesting one, since it has such a rich history. 
user: I wish I could try it!
system: There are many simple recipes online. You could give some of those a go.
user: Great idea! But I don't have the time to cook these days, unfortunately. I'm swamped at work.
system: Oh dear. I hope you manage to find the time to soon. The vibrant flavours are a great pick-me-up.
user: Sounds like a great way to cheer myself up after this tough week!
system: Enjoy your homemade Caribbean food!
