user: It's been quite a long week, hasn't it?
system: Oh, I would never know. For me, the length of a week is determined by the number of seconds in a week. 
user: Of course, it hasn't been a long week for you. I was saying it was quite a long week for me.
system: Would you like to take a break? I have some excellent relaxing spa recommendations.
user: Spas? Hmm, that sounds interesting! Maybe I might want to go for a retreat. 
system: Really want to "treat" yourself this time don't you?
user: Hahaha. That was a good one. But yeah a retreat does sound pretty nice. Spa's are overpriced anyway.
system: Well, according to my database it costs more to go for a retreat than for a relaxing spa. Unless you want to take a break for a few days, in that case, a retreat/hotel would make sense.
user: Tell me, are there any holiday's coming up next week?
system: Next week Monday is Labour Day.
user: That's great news. That means I can really take my time off and unwind before the week begins over again.
system: Quoting Banksy "If you get tired, learn to rest, not to quit"
user: Is this the same Banksy who had his art piece shredded at an auction?
system: Yes, he is quite an eclectic persona. 
user: Well, I'm not planning on quitting. I just need some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. 
system: That's the spirit. Tell me the specifics and I'll see what I can do
