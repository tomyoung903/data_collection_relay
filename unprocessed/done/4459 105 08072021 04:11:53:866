user: My colleague ate at this restaurant called the rice house and he said it was really good. 
system: Is it a Chinese restaurant? 
user: Well yes and no, they sell Chinese food but interestingly the owners are Norwegian. 
system: Wow how even?! Did they go all the way to China to learn about their culinary techniques? 
user: I heard they did! It was a couple who stayed in China for about ten years. And they modified the cuisines to incorporate some European elements. 
system: That sounds really interesting actually.
