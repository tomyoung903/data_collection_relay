user: It has been months since I went back to China. 
system: How are you coping so far? 
user: Between school and my part time job, I haven't really had time to miss home. I talk to my family every weekend online, so that really helps. 
system: I see, are you feeling homesick recently? 
user: Haha, I've been missing the taste of Chinese food today...  
system: Oh, I really like dumplings! 
user: The Chinese restaurants are not exactly the same, but I suppose it would help with getting that Asian flavour. 
system: Hopefully the food can help with your homesickness!
