system: Maybe you should take advantage of it. 
user: You're right, I've requested for a day off. Fortunately my boss gave approval. 
system: Sounds great! Are you going to spend some time with friends or family. 
user: Not really, I've been spending a lot of time with them lately. I haven't had some time for myself.
