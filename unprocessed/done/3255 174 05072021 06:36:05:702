user: I thought that the journey would be longer than this to watch both my movie and read a book on the journey. Which should I choose? 
system: You should choose the one that you prefer doing more to make the most of your commute! 
user: I should decide based on my personal preference on what I want to do, but I'm tied between the choices! 
system: If you're tied for choices, you may look out the window if you happen to take the window seat! 
user: Staring at the scenery by the window seat seems like a great idea, but what happens if I fail to secure a window seat? 
system: In that case, you can put all of your distractions away and take a look around the train. You can take a detailed look at the design of the train or even what the other commuters are doing.  
user: I like your suggestion but it will be awkward if the other commuters caught me looking at them, if that happens what should I do? 
system: You can either choose to avert your eyes away from them or flash a smile at them. A simple smile can draw the distance closer between two people when the smile is returned!
