user: I have been experiencing back pains recently. 
system: How bad is the pain? You should see a doctor if the pain persists!  
user: It's not that serious. It's probably due to a lack of exercise. 
system: You can go for a swim at the pool to strengthen your core. 
user: That is a great idea. I should probably start out slow. 
system: You will get used to it! You don't have to swim fast.
