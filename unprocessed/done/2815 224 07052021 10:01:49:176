user: err wait, can I do a walk-in booking? I almost forgot, lol. Everyone's so pumped so I wanna make sure the trip is smooth sailing but we've no time to book the hotel now tho cause the trip is so impromptu. We haven't even started packing. 
system: Ooo an impromptu trip, cool! Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but there are strictly no walk-ins. Anyway, I can book the hotel for you. It'll only take a minute. 
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
