user: That's great. Do you think any advance booking is necessary since it's not tourist season?
system: The accommodation has 15 of its 30 rooms vacant. Since peak season is about to start, the vacancies could fill up quickly. Do you want me to book you a room?
user: I am unsure of my current travel plans. What is the reservation cancellation policy of the accommodation.
system: You will not be charged for the room if the booking is cancelled 48 hours prior to intended stay period. Should I proceed to book?
user: Not just yet, let me get back to you on that in sometime. Thanks for the help though.
system: Sure! No problem, Have a great day. Hoping to assist you soon!
