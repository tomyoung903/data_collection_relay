system: I wouldn't fuss! It brings me joy to find answers to your questions! 
user: Really? Then I wouldn't hesitate to ask you more questions! 
system: Sure, it's not the answer that enlightens but the question. Only after wondering why, you will know the reason why things is how it is!

system: It's never ending - the world is always evolving with hopes to find the better tomorrows. 
user: That's quite true! Is there any difference between knowledge and intelligence? 
system: The main difference between knowledge and intelligence is that knowledge is having the right answer but intelligence is asking the right question.
