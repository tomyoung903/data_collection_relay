user: Some of our business partners from overseas flew in today for some meetings, and I had to attend all of them. 
system: That sounds rough. I hope you can catch a break. 
user: I should have my break once the meetings ended, but my boss told me to book a place for dinner with the business partners this week. 
system: Sounds like you have quite a difficult boss. 
user: At least the dinner is not held today. But I have trouble deciding on a place. 
system: Maybe you can ask your boss for some opinions ? 
user: I heard that she likes Chinese cuisine. I'm sure she will love to treat our business associates to it. 
system: I'm sure your boss will be pleased that you picked her preference too.
