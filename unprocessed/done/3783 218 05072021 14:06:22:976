system: I hope the food there will cure your homesickness. 
user: But I also hope the food there can be authentic. 
system: It's quite hard to fulfill this request, as everyone has different standards of authenticness.  
user: Yeah, I know that. I will try to set my expectation lower then. 
system: I don't think the food there will let you down. I hope you can taste your real authentic food in your hometown soon!
