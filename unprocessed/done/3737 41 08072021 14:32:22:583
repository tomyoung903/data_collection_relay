user: I have finally graduated high school! 
system: Congratulations! You have completed another milestone in life. 
user: Although I'm happy, I can't help but worry about my future. 
system: Would you like to share your woes? 
user: I'm nervous about getting my results. What if I did badly and couldn't get into college? 
system: What's done has been done. Worrying wouldn't change anything, so why not put it aside? 
user: You're right. Maybe I could go scout for potential colleges to take my mind off these troubling thoughts. 
system: Good idea. Stay positive, and always remember that grades don't define us.
