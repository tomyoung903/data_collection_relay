user: I wanted to bring my friends to an italian restaurant because some of them are more used to the western cuisine. 
system: They should try some indian food too. It is good. 
user: I hope they will like indian food though. I don't think they will be used to the taste of spices in it. 
system: You might be right. Italian food don't usually use as much spices as indian food. 
user: That is a little concerning. I will feel bad if they don't enjoy themselves. 
system: Don't worry! You can always ask the staff there for recommendations.
