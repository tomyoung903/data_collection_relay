user: I am still thinking of what kind of food I should write about in my blog after British-styled ones.
system: Is it a food blog you are writing for?
user: It is a mix of a travel and food blog. I just started writing it last month. Do you have any suggestions for what food I should try out next? I have written about Italian food already.
system: That sounds interesting. There are many kinds of food, such as Mexican, Korean and Greek ones, to try out.
