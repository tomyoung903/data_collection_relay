user: I wanna eat Tafelspitz :( I cant forget the taste even I have left Austria for 4 years 
system: Dude, you are in Singapore. Austria is millions miles away. There is no "Austr" in Austria, but we have "Ind". 
user: :0...
Same season all year round,
Close bosom-friend of the matruing sun, 
Nostalgic austrian,
Only have garlic winnowing wind.
system: How can you make a poem about that, haha. Its fine, next time I'll take you to other part of the town to grab some real austrian food.
