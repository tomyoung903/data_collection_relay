user: My husband is very indecisive when it comes to ordering, he's always unsure what he wants. 
system: I suggest that you can order a variety of dishes at the restaurant that he likes and all of you can share it. That will be better! 
user: We will be able to try different food if we do that! 
system: Definitely! You can have a taste of all the food you ordered instead of just sticking to one!
