user: Tomorrow's the final day of exams, I can't wait for it to be over ! 
system: That's great news ! I wish you all the best for your exam results. 
user: My classmates and I will be going out to celebrate over dinner tomorrow. Maybe we will get drunk ! 
system: That sounds fun, but it is always wise to be careful with alcohol. 
user: I know some of my classmates do not drink. I should find a gastropub restaurant that can satisfy all of us. 
system: That is very thoughtful of you to consider that.
