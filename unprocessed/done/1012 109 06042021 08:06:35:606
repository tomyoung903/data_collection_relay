user: My Uber driver was late and slow the last time I had to go to Ely.
system: I'm sorry to hear that. Was there a traffic jam?
user: Nah, but I think he misread the map.
system: Humans do have a tendency to make mistakes like that.
user: What about a train? Do you think that'd be faster?
system: An excellent idea. Trains don't have a tendency to get lost.
