user: My friends and I really have very different ideas about many things. 
system: I mean it is perfectly normal for people to hold different ideas, that's what makes things interesting isn't it. 
user: Yeah but we are all the type that really likes to prove ourselves right, so it is truly a recipe for disaster. 
system: Wow okay that does not sound fun. Do you guys always debate and try to win the argument. 
user: Yes that is what we end up doing most of the time hahaha. But hey we don't hold any resentment against each other. 
system: I mean reasonably you shouldn't? It is so stupid if you do that. 
user: Hey come on for us with such characters it is actually a tough thing to do! We are meeting here in Norwich again this week can't wait. 
system: I hope you guys don't end up debating again but instead just enjoy your time together.
