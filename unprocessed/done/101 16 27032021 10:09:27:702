user: Hey there! I was thinking about ways to take a breather from studying and I was talking about it with my friends.
system: Oh, what did you come up with?
user: Well, not much. But they mentioned that a short getaway sometimes helps, and I'm considering it. I would have to leave from school, though...
system: Oh, where do you study at? Maybe I can help you check if there's any good transportation from there.
user: Wow, that would be nice! I'm currently at Cambridge.
system: Alright! I don't think I'll take too long to search it up.
