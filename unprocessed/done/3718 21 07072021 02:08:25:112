user: I just found out that Monday is not the first day of the week. 
system: Many people today assume it to be the first day of the week because that is when work starts, which unfortunately is not the case. 
user: Speaking of which, tomorrow is Sunday which is the actual first day of the week, and I have a day off which I am using to travel. 
system: I hope you have a good time traveler.
