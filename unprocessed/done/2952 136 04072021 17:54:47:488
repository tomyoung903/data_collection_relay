user: I'm thinking of enrolling in a college near the central area since it's near my grandmother's. 
system: That's a good idea. It's always good to stay near a relative. 
user: Right? I will start by looking around the one with free entrance since my pay has yet to come in and I'm broke. But I don't want to burden my grandmother by staying at her place so I'll settle with the hotel. 
system: Can you afford the expensive hotel stay? 
user: I'll go check it in person first. 
system: Okay, good luck!
