user: My anniversary’s coming up! 
system: That’s great! I assume you have something special planned? 
user: You bet I do. I’m taking my wife to go sightseeing, and then we’ll end the day off with a romantic dinner.  
system: Sounds lovely! I assume you’ll be heading out of town? 
user: Yeah definitely. It wouldn’t be as special if we just stayed here in boring old London Liverpool Street.  
system: I suppose you’re right, good thinking!
