user: I love travelling by train! 
system: Why would you say that, may I ask? 
user: I just love how everything feels when I sit in the train and see the world go by. It just gets better if it is a long distance express train and I have food! 
system: I am happy for you! I hope you get to do that sometime. 
user: In fact, there is a trip coming up this Tuesday that I am looking forward to! Even though it is a shorter one. 
system: Sorry to hear that, but I would be glad to help you with that.
