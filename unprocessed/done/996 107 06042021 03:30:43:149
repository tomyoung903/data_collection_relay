user: I can't believe it. My daughter's already been at college for four months.
system: That's a while. Time flies, doesn't it?
user: It really does. I miss her, though. It's her birthday this Saturday and it's the first one she'll be spending away from me.
system: Perhaps you could surprise her with a visit?
user: Actually, I could! Her college isn't too far.
system: It's a plan then. Do you need help with transport?
