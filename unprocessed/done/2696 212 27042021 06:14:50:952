user: Wow! That sounds convenient, what if I am not able to get a ride through the app?
system: You can always hitch a ride from the sidewalk, you could also find a nearby restaurant or cafe to rest until the rain stops. 
user: Hopefully, the weather will be good.
system: I hope so too. If not, rainy weather can be a relaxing time if you appreciate it. Enjoy your time there!
