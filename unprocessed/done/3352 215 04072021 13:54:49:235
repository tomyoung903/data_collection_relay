user: Do you think it is appropriate to wear dress casual to the Saigon City or do we have to dress formally? 
system: Smart casual outfits should be fine. After all, you're also visiting the park. it would be uncomfortable to wear formal clothes to the park. 
user: you're right. I would take that into consideration. 
system: I think you will enjoy the scenery at the park and the food in the restaurant!
