user: I guess I will visit the free museums then. I can save money. 
system: It's free and you can learn more about history at the same time. It's like killing two birds with one stone isn't it? 
user: Yes. Everything is getting more and more expensive lately so I have to be more frugal. 
system: You can use the extra money to do other activities instead.  
user: That's a good idea. Hopefully my family will enjoy the visit. 
system: I'm sure they will enjoy themselves at the museum!
