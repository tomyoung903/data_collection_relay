user: I have always loved going to airports. 
system: Why is that so? 
user: Well it gives me the nice illusion that I am going to travel when I am not, and you get to see a diverse range of people! 
system: That's fair, but isn't it sad to be there and knowing deep down you are not going anywhere. 
user: I don't think so? Like I always goes to stansted airport with my friends and we just get so immersed in it we don't even think about that. I am going there again this week! It is a really nice place! 
system: I see. To me there's really not much different between them and any shopping malls.
