user: Alright. This birthday surprise is going to be great! 
system: Is it your birthday? 
user: Oh no we are planning on for my niece. She always wanted to visit Cambridge.  
system: That's new, most people go to Cambridge for studies, not pleasure.  
user: She heard about it from some documentary she watched and was taken to it quite rapidly. She has been badgering her parents to take her there for awhile now and we finally have the time to do so as a family.  
system: I hope the surprise goes well. Quite a big party for 7 people. 
user: Yes indeed, a chance for a much needed family get away too.  
system: Sounds like a wonderful family. Wish her a happy birthday from me too.
