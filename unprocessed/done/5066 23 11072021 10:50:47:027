user: It’s my boyfriend’s birthday this Saturday! 
system: Happy birthday to him! Does he have any plans? 
user: Actually, I’m planning on doing a surprise visit to his college!  
system: Aww, how sweet of you.  
user: I really miss him. I haven’t seen him since he moved to college.  
system: Because the both of you have been really busy?

system: Well, at least you’ll see him this Saturday!
