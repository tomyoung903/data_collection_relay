user: I sure hope so. The college is one of the best in the country.
system: When will you get your enrolment results?
user: Next week. My mother wishes me to be able to study at saint john's college.
system: Everything is great as long as you are happy. It would be torture to have to spend a few years in an environment that you dislike. It would be wise to do your research on saint john's college before enrolling there!
user: You are right. That is why I am going over to do some scouting before making a decision. 
system: Good luck with your enrolment results!
