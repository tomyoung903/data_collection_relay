system: Are you perhaps looking for something more active? You must love sports!
user: I do! But its alright. I'll be meeting my brother whom I have not seen for 8 years! We should do something he likes for a change.
system: Wow! That's long! I'm sure your brother will appreciate your thoughtfulness.
