user: Nice. I'm here to meet my cousins and siblings. 
system: Alright. Just a casual family get together? 
user: Yeah. We like to meet up every now and then.  
system: That's sweet. Have you always been close to them? 
user: Yes. We all lived together in our younger days. And as we grew older, we always stayed in touch. 
system: That's rare. You all are very lucky. 
user: That's true. I'm lucky to have such supportive family members. 
system: What do you guys do when you get together? 
user: Depends. We usually order pizza and ice cream and talk and drink and watch something. 
system: Good thing you can watch as much as you want on the free wifi.
