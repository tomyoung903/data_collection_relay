user: Great. I've been assigned to manage a new office. 
system: That's great. Is this a promotion of sorts? 
user: More like a probationary promotion. 
system: What does that mean? 
user: Good question. My boss has been happy with my work lately. So much so that he recommended me for a senior project management role. 
system: Sounds exciting.  
user: It is. It also comes with higher pay. But for now, I've been tasked to work at the office and get on my feet for a month. 
system: I see. What happens after the month passes? 
user: After the month they are going to review my progress, see if I have what it takes for the new role.  
system: Is a month enough time for you? 
user: I'm not sure. I really want the job. But only being evaluated for a month seem pretty stressful. I'm probably going to be working overtime. 
system: Good thing you can at least relax and watch something on the free wifi.
