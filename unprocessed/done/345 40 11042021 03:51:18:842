user: It's tiring to have to travel to Cambridge just to attend a celebration.
system: I agree, the amount of time wasted on travelling adds up over time.
user: If only the celebration was not mandatory, but because I am an important guest, I have to attend.
system: That's unfortunate. They should have listened to your preference, considering how important you are!
user: If only they would! I wish they had chosen a closer area instead.
system: Sometimes we do not get what we wish for.
