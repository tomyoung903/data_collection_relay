user: I suddenly remembered that my boyfriend's family hinted that they were craving korean food. 
system: Are you trying to impress them by taking them to a korean restaurant? 
user: Haha yes. I just got my bonus so I can afford to splurge on expensive food for now. I hope they enjoy themselves. 
system: That's great. I'm sure they will appreciate the effort you put in to plan for everything. 
user: I hope they will! 
system: Don't worry and just enjoy yourselves!
