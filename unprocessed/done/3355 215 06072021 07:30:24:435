user: my family love noodles, this sounds like a good option! are the food spicy though? my younger siblings can't take spicy food. 
system: there is a variety of options in Yippee Noodle Bar, I think your siblings will be able to find one that suits them. 
user: that's nice to hear. is there free parking? 
system: yes, are you taking your family shopping in town after lunch? 
user: indeed. it has been quite long since we've been out on a shopping trip, I wanted to get my parents some presents.
