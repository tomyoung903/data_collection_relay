user: My children have been feeling quite bored playing in the neighbourhood lately. 
system: Are there any areas they haven't been to? 
user: I don't think so. I feel bored too, seeing the same places. 
system: Maybe it's time to head to other towns. 
user: Maybe. The whole family will be busy until Friday, so we should make use of the weekend. Thanks for the idea! 
system: Glad that I could help.
