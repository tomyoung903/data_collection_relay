user: I have been craving home made chocolate chip cookies for some time now.
system: Cookies with dark chocolate, white chocolate, or milk chocolate?
user: Mix of dark and milk chocolate. Which kind do you prefer?
system: Always dark chocolate. 
user: Nice choice. So I was trying to bake them at home and they donâ€™t taste quite the same as my mother's. I love living at Cambridge but my mother does not live here and I really want to see her and eat her cookies. 
system: I think you should visit her.
