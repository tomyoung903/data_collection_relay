user: My kids love ice-cream!  
system: I am sure they do, there are a lot of flavors to choose from!  
user: They even say that they want to try making those ice cream!  
system: Do you know how to make it? 
user: I am not sure but my wife learnt it before! 
system: I suggest that you and your family can have a little family bonding activity by making ice-creams at the hotel room! 
user: That will be a great activity to do together!  
system: All of you will certainly have some fun! You can try the ice cream you made at the hotel once it is done!
