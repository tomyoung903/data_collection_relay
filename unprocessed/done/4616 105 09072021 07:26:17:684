user: My friend tim visited a museum and he said it was super educational. 
system: I mean I would expect that right cause that is what it is meant to be. 
user: Yes but all the museums i have visited are super non-educational, they barely have any explanations for things on display. 
system: Haha I am so sorry to hear that, perhaps you haven't visited the good ones.
