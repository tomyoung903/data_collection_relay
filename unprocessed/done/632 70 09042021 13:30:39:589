user: I heard there are quite some popular ones littered around town

user: No, I am driving up further north to visit my aunt but my car broke down. Now I am holed up at Trent motel while waiting for my ride to get fixed.
system: I am so sorry! Trent is on the west of the river which cuts through the town center. There are indeed a few gems in your area!
