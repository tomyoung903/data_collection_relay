user: Actually... there's something I'd like to know. Is it gonna be cumbersome to get from the university arms hotel to old schools?
system: Blimey! That's the best part. It's so near you can actually walk from the hotel.
user: Hm, ok. That's about it. 
system: Be prepared to be gobsmacked by the awesome sceneries during your walk! Stay safe.
