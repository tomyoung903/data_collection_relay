user: I just bought a new laptop! Another dream fulfilled. 
system: Wow nice! What did you buy? 
user: I bought a HP Spectre, honestly a damn beast, I really like its overall design. 
system: Was it very expensive though, aren't most high end laptops very costly. 
user: Well I actually bought it online, so there was a discount of like 25%, really a steal. 
system: Ah so have you actually received the laptop? 
user: Not yet! It is arriving on Wednesday, so I am still stuck with my old one but I already can't wait. 
system: Hahaha you were speaking as if you already got your hands on it and you are admiring its beauty.
