user: My family have been very busy at work in the office recently. It's a rare opportunity for them to be free and I hope they will enjoy this trip! 
system: I am sure they will. You can organize a small picnic at the park too. It allows all of you to be outdoors and breath some fresh air while enjoying the view of the natural environment! 
user: That's a very good idea! I hope they will feel relaxed after this.  
system: Being in outdoor environments allows them to restore their mind from the mental fatigue of work. It can help with family bonding too!
