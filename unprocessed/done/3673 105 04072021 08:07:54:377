user: Honestly one of my biggest regrets was to drop out of high school. 
system: Why did you do it? 
user: Young and stupid. Deceived by the idea that you can be successful by just hustling. 
system: Well everyone makes different life choices along the way,  I'm sure you would have other regrets if you went on a different path. 
user: Not wrong, but I really wanted to get a feel of how college is like. 
system: Never too late, it is all about life long learning these days.
