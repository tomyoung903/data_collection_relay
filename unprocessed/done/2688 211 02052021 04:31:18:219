user: Thanks. My wife is Indian and she loves spicy food! I should probably take her to a place that offer spicy options.
system: She has a good taste in food! Curry prince might be able to offer some spicy curries of her choice.
user: Hmm. I am looking forward to it! Thanks for your suggestion. Do you think I should take my children along? They prefer something more bland to eat.
system: I am happy to help! I am sure a restaurant would have different options to satiate a variety of customers. Otherwise, your children might enjoy trying something different!
