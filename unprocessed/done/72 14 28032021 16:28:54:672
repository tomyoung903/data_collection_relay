user: Good morning! It's going to be a busy day today!
system: Well, I hope you had a good night's rest. 
user: I didn't. I woke up a few times in the middle of the night.
system: What was the reason for that?
user: I kept dreaming about not being able to flag a taxi today, and that my plans got ruined because of it. 
system: Oh no, that's worrying. What can I do to help?
