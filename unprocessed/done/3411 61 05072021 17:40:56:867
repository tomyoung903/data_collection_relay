user: I'm very hesitant about my relationship with my girlfriend. 
system: May I ask what is happened? 
user: My girlfriend and I used to work together in my hometown, Stevenage. Recently, she got an opportunity for promotion, but she needs to work in Cambridge for two years.  
system: Oh, living apart is indeed a big headache for all couples. So, what's her opinion? 
user: Hmmm, she has left already. I am hesitating... 
system: Hesitating about what? 
user: Maybe I could try Cambridge too...but I am afraid of leaving the place I was born and raised. 
system: My friend, do not worry too much. Why not just have a try?
