user: Oh god I forgot that this Thursday's my anniversary!
system: Oh dear. Congratulations, but it sounds like you have nothing prepared.
user: We first met in Cambridge, the missus and I. We didn't spend much on the first date, too.
system: Is it an important anniversary? 10 years, perhaps?
user: 5. 5's pretty important, too.
system: Perhaps you could do a repeat of your first date. Spending just as much.
user: I don't think I could book a restaurant on short notice. And I don't want to get a taxi or a bus like last time. Maybe a train.
system: There are other modes of transport.
