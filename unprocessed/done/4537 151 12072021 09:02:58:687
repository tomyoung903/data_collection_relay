user: It's okay. My wife is busy at work so I'm left to feed the kids. 
system: I see. Do you know how to cook? 
user: That's the thing. I don't. My wife has always been cooking for us. 
system: Why didn't you try learning how to cook? 
user: It was never needed. I always ate out if I needed to.

user: She has. But we always had leftovers in the fridge. This time it was unexpected. 
system: I see. Well, you should definitely try and learn cooking. It's an important skill. 
user: I will. Can't let this happen again. For now, I hope my kids don't mind the other option. 
system: I'm sure they'll enjoy pizza hut.
