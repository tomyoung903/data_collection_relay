user: I'm so tired and I need to wake up early. 
system: The art should wake you up. 
user: You think so? I think art is pretty boring. What's worse is that I have to do research on the art history. Hopefully they have some religious stuff. 
system: Are you doing research for the church? 
user: Yes. They suddenly seemed interested about old art. 
system: Good luck with your research! I think the people at the church will learn a lot from your studies!
