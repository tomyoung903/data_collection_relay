user: There's this girl I'm trying to get to know more. This is sort of like a date.
system: But you made a booking for multiple people. Is this going to be a group date?
user: Her friend and my buddy are going to be there to make things less awkward.
system: I see. So they're being wingmen for their two friends?
user: Seems that way.
system: Well, all the best with your date.
