user: i've been robbed! i think he did it when he bumped into me in the toilet just now! 
system: oh dear. do you still remember how he looks like? 
user: i think i still have a slight recollection. it has been quite a while though. i should have checked my belongings just now! 
system: don't beat yourself up over it, hurry down to the police station and inform them. you might still have a chance to get back your valuables.
