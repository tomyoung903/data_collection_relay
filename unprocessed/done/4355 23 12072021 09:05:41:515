user: I have to leave town for some bloody company lunch.  
system: I’m sure it’ll be over before you know it.  
user: What’s worse is that my company isn’t even cover my whole trip to the lunch place! 
system: Really? 
user: Yeah! They’re expecting to settle the trip from the train station to the restaurant myself! Unbelievable! 
system: That’s a real shame.  
user: Ugh. Why couldn’t they pick someplace within walking-distance to Ely Train Station? Then I wouldn’t have to pay for anything at all! 
system: I guess there’s nothing much you can do in this situation.
