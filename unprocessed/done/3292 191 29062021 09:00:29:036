user: Nothing much. I sure hope I make a good impression on my date. 
system: First date? 
user: Yes, we met on the internet and she mentioned she is a history buff.  
system: I see why you picked a museum. 
user: I am not that into museums, but to make a good first impression, I am okay with it.  
system: Maybe you should read up on some artifacts as well, as a way to impress her. 
user: You know what, that actually sounds like a great idea, thank you. 
system: All the best for your date.
