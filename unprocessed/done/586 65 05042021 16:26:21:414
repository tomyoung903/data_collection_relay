user: Hi, it's been such a hassle organising this trip. It seems like there's more and more to do everyday.
system: Hello, that does not sound good. What's causing you problems now?
user: Aside from all the administrative issues that I have to handle . I have people who would not reply to my texts even though the trip is on Wednesday and I need to book my transport. All of this planning is causing so much stress.
system: That does not sound like a good experience. I can understand why you would be stressed. But do not worry! I am here to help.
