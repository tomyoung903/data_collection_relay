user: Since this is a holiday I planned for my older relatives and grandparents, is the Castle Galleries elderly-friendly? 
system: Castle Galleries have structures for the wheelchair-bound and their staff are all very patient. I think your family members should not have much of an issue. 
user: that is reassuring! hopefully my family have a good time there and I don't burn a hole in my wallet. 
system: Autumn House and Castle Galleries are all cheaper options around the area. I believe both you and your family will love it there.
