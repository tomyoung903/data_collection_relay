user: My grandmother is quite sick, she is in the hospital. I have to reach her as fast as possible.
system: I am sorry to hear that. Don't worry she will get well soon.
user: I hope that she pulls through in this age. There is no one there to take care of her.
system: Oh, then you should try to reach her soon. She will be quite happy to have her family around.
