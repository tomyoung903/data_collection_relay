user: I vaguely remember someone in my group saying that she was allergic to some kind of plant or something. 
system: Oh no. Are you sure it is a good idea to go to the garden then? 
user: Oh wells whatever. I don't like her that much anyways. 
system: I hope nothing goes too horribly wrong. Hopefully the European food can cheer everyone up if anything really goes awry. 
user: Haha. It will become a good story to tell at party next time if anything goes wrong. 
system: That's true. I do hope you all will enjoy yourselves though otherwise I will feel bad for suggesting you the gardens.
