user: Broxbourne used to have really good scenary, I wonder what happened. 
system: Really? When was the last time you visited? 
user: Well okay granted it was 15 years ago, but things really changed a lot! I just saw the photos of it now, trees disappeared, large buildings came up, it makes me sad. 
system: I mean I am all about conservation but sometimes we do have to move forward to improve the lives of people
