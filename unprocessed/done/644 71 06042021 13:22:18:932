user: The rain has finally stopped.
system: Indeed it has. Don't you think it would be a good time to go out?
user: In fact, I think I just might. What are your favourite places to go?

user: Hmm. I second that idea. I would say that museums would be a good pick!
system: Hopefully you can find what you like.
