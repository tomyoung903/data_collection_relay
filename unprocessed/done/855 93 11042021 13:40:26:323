user: I am stressed out after a huge project and I am in need of a vacation to release it.
system: I hope you are okay. What kind of vacation do you like?
user: I like to travel to a place where it is not too well known. Somewhere that is not popular or crowded with tourists
system: There are some countries that are worth visiting with those conditions.
user: I am too busy to fly to other countries now. A staycation near Cambridge is what I would love to right now. I heard from my parents that Broxbourne is a good place to distress, which is close to London.
system: It would be nice to distress once in a while with a short trip.
