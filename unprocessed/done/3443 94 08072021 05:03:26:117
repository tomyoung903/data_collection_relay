user: I am actually meeting up with a friend who studies here, and she is going to bring me around town while we hang out. 
system: It is very nice of your friend to be your guide during your visit here. 
user: Unfortunately I got lost while trying to make my way to our meeting spot.  
system: That sounds like trouble. Have you tried calling your friend for help ?
