user: I'm at Sidney Sussex College for a student reunion party.
system: It is nice to meet up with friends from your old school once in a while.
user: I can't wait to catch up with the boys back in school ! It's been more that three years !
system: Three years ? There will plenty to catch up on then.
user: Unfortunately I need to leave the party early to catch a delivery.
system: It is wise to be at home when a delivery arrives, you never know what will happen to the package.
