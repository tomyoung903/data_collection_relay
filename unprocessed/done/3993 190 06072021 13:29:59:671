system: You can bring your gaming console to the hotel room and play together with your friends. You can play for a few hours at night when all of you are free! 
user: That's great. I hope we can all have fun together!  
system: You can bring some multiplayer games from your gaming console so that all of you can have interaction too! 
user: I planned to do it. I just bought one or two games of that. 
system: That's great! All of you will definitely have an enjoyable night after a long day out!
