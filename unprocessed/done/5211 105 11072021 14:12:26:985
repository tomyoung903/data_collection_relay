user: Hey did you hear about the news? My favourite band is having a concert in UK!! 
system: Wow you must be a really big fan of them, have you bought the tickets already. 
user: What do you think. Of course I have, it is a once in a lifetime thing they rarely come here. 
system: Can I just ask are you a fan of their music or like the entire group as a whole. 
user: The group of course, everyone in there is so cute! Can't believe they decided to hold it in Peterborough! 
system: I see! How much did the tickets cost?
