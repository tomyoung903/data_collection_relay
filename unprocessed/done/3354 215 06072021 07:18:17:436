user: thank you. i am thinking of going with either my wife and 2 children or with my friends. which do you suggest? 
system: i think this trip would serve as a good opportunity to bond with your family members. your children can learn a lot from visiting castle galleries too. 
user: i'm afraid my children will be too young to understand anything though. 
system: people of any ages can enjoy art and have their own interpretation at castle galleries. i believe your children will stand to benefit too.
