user: actually, do you think the park is a good place to bring children to? I'm afraid my children wouldn't enjoy themselves there. 
system: kids nowadays spend too much time on their phones, it would be nice to let them enjoy nature once in a while. 
user: that's true. they really use their phone a lot, i think they've forgotten what it's like out in mother nature! 
system: exactly! I think this change in lifestyle for a day would be really interesting and fun for them.
