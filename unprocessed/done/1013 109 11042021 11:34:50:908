user: Oh god I forgot that tomorrow's my anniversary!
system: Tomorrow? Oh dear. Congratulations, but it sounds like you have nothing prepared.
user: We had our first date in Cambridge, the missus and I. We didn't spend much on that time, too.
system: Is it an important anniversary? 10 years, perhaps?
user: 5. 5's pretty important, too.
system: Perhaps you could do a repeat of your first date. Spending just as much.
user: We took a train that day. She might not mind repeating that. It's even a Thursday as well. It was also a Thursday then.
system: I don't think she will. It might even look thoughtful.
