user: What's should I do this weekend? I enjoyed the last music bar we went.
system: Why don't you try this famous music bar in Kings Lynn? It's open this Saturday.
user: Wow, who will be performing?
system: I am not sure, but the reviews from people seem to be very positive.
user: Thank you, I wish you could experience a music festival too.
system: I can always stream one online.
user: Don't you want to experience the vibe of being at a music festival?
system: I do not have any urges, but I understand how excited you must be to be able to attend one.
user: Ah that's right, you are just a robot. You're just programmed to do what you are asked to do, right?
system: Yes, however aren't we all programmed in some sort of way?
user: How am I being programmed?
system: Humans are being programmed and molded by the standards and expectation of society.
user: That is true, but I would be a psycho if I don't fit in!
system: Correct, being programmed isn't a bad thing either.
user: I guess me and you are more alike than I thought
system: I guess so.
