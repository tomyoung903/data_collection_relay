user: I'm grateful. It's my friend's daughter's wedding today. 
system: Congratulations to her. How old is she? 
user: If I remember correctly, she's just turning 28 later this year. Her fiance seems like a good kid. Love marriage. 
system: Aww, that's really sweet.  
user: Yeah. My friend and his wife seem happy. They can't wait to have grandkids to spoil. 
system: Congratulations to them as well. 
user: Yeah. The wedding is at 7. My friend does want me to come early.  
system: How early? Did he mention anything? 
user: Not really. I'm just hoping I arrive on time. His early usually means 30 mins before. I hope I reach on time. 
system: It's alright. You can always call taxi number if you have any queries.
