user: Do you think my friend will enjoy Indian food too? 
system: If your friend has not tried it before, I believe it will be an interesting experience. Did you and your friend decide on Moroccan food initially? 
user: We did. Sadly, we can't try it out this time. 
system: I am sure you and your friend will have plenty of chances to try Moroccan food elsewhere in the future. 
user: I am looking forward to that already. 
system: In the meantime, enjoy the Indian food taj tandoori serves. I am sure it won't disappoint too.
