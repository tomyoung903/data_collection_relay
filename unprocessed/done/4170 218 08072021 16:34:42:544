user: I am going to investigate a criminal case at that place. I need someplace that is quiet for me to let me solve the case. 
system: Wow, that sounds interesting. I believe the environment at that place will never let you down. Besides that, maybe renting a car there will improve your efficiency in doing your job. 
user: I will consider that. I just hope my work will go smoothly. 
system: Maybe you can try to cooperate with the local police force. 
user: I don't think I will need to cooperate with them. I will do this on my own. 
system: I believe you can settle this on your own!
