user: Wait a minute... it's a budget hotel but has 4-stars? Are you for real? I don't believe you. 
system: Well, ma'am/sir, not to be rude but I am a system and anything I tell you is a consolidated finding from the database I have. If you're really that sus about the hotel, I can pull up the reviews for you. Would that be better?
user: Fair enough. No need. That's all. Adios!
system: Adios to you too! Have a nice trip.
