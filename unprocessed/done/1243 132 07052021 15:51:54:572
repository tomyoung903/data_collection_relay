user: Hmm...well my son loves to read. But he's a bit of a nerd...and I don't want to bring him to the same places that he always goes to. I would rather he go to places where he can interact with other people. I'm very worried about how he would cope in the future with his lack of social skills...
system: Oh not to worry, I am somewhat of a nerd as well, and I turned out fine. Perhaps finding places that interest him might be better than making him uncomfortable though.
user: Hmm... you're right. I'll read up on some of these places before booking a trip. I sure hope my son enjoys this trip.
system: He definitely would, especially since you've put in so much effort planning it. 
user: You don't know him though. He's an angsty teenager who doesn't want to be seen with his dad.
system: Boy, do they grow up fast don't they?
user: Yeah, it feels like just yesterday when he was such a tiny baby. 
system: On the bright side, you don't have to change so many diapers anymore.
