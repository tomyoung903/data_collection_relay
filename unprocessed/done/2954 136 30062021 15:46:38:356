user: My friend from India is coming to visit. He wants to know how authentic the Indian food here is. 
system: How interesting! I'm sure the restaurant will be to his liking. 
user: I hope so. Cultural food generally aren't true to the kind they serve back at the home country. 
system: The cuisine at an expensive restaurant shouldn't be too bad. 
user: You're right. They have to maintain a certain standard if they are going to charge high prices. 
system: That's right. Don't worry too much and enjoy the Indian food!
