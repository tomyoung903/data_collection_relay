user: Hi, I will be having my annual leave and I intend to visit cambridge soon. It will be my first time there and I want to make the most use of my leave. It has been a while since I had time to take a break and chill. Work and studies have prevented me from going on a vacation
system: Well I think that there are a lot of things you can do. There are many wonderful restaurants to go to, there are also a lot of beautiful places to visit.
user: That sounds amazing, I am looking forward to my trip even more now. I can't wait until I get there and enjoy my break.
system: Sounds delightful. There are so many things that you can do while you are here. Is there anything that you have yet to confirm?
