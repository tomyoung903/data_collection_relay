user: Yes. My little one fell down and I think might have broken his arm.
system: Oh dear, that sounds serious. Should we tell someone else about this incident too?
user: Yes, can you please message my son's father and tell him. We're divorced but he should know about his son.
system: Sure thing. I'm sorry to hear that though.
user: Don't be. I'm glad that we're no longer married. It was a pain in the neck.
system: Well I'm not surprised. Marriages don't always work out. I hope your son recovers soon though.
