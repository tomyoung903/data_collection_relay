user: I received interest from an asian client about the area.  
system: Oh, that's great news. Is he new to the region? 
user: Yup. He has been living outside the UK for the past few years.  
system: Alright. Why is he moving into the country now? 
user: Due to his children's future education, he wants to immigrate in. I'm hoping to impress him and his family once he has arrived, especially by touting the Chinese culture in the region 
system: So this is like a scouting mission? 
user: Yeah, something like that. I have never had external clients before so this is pretty big for me. 
system: I understand. Food is one way to a person's heart and I'm sure if you enjoy Hakka, he will enjoy it too. 
user: Let's hope so. 
system: If not there are always other dining options. You'll be fine
