user: My wife is really mad at me today.  
system: Why? What happened? 
user: I did not wish her for her birthday.  
system: Oh no. That is bad. You should probably make a grand gesture and make her special. 
user: Last time she was mad at me I took her to a museum and she loved it. Maybe we could see some architecture this time before I leave for my work trip. 
system: Do you think she will like it?
