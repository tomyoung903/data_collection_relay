user: I met this really cute girl the other day and we're going on a date. 
system: Congratulations! You must be excited. 
user: I am looking forward to it, but she wants to visit a museum for our date. 
system: That sounds like a fun activity. Is there a problem? 
user: Yes, because I don't know anything about them so I don't know where to go. 
system: That sounds difficult. Maybe you should try narrowing down by choosing an area to go to.
