user: A bunch of my extended relatives are coming to town for vacation. I hate it when they come over. 
system: It sounds like quite a party, why do you dislike it? 
user: They are very competitive. Especially when it comes to their homeland, they are very proud of it. 
system: I think it's fine to be proud of the country you belong to. 
user: They challenged me to find a restaurant that serves good chinese food. They said nothing can be better outside of China.
