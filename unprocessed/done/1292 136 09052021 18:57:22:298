user: I'm celebrating my friend's birthday. I hope the restaurant has birthday celebrations!
system: Is it a surprise birthday celebration? I would expect the restaurant to have food fit for a celebration.
user: Yes it is! She loves surprises, but it's very hard to surprise her!
system: Good luck with your surprise. Hopefully none of your other friends blabber to her about the surprise!
user: It would be a pity if she doesn't get surprised after all the hard work we put in. Ben, my friend who is part of the surprise team, is such a big mouth.
system: You better keep a close eye on him then!
