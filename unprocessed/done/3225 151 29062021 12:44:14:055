user: I'm good for now, thanks. I'm meeting my brother and sister for dinner. 
system: That's good to hear. Just a casual gathering? 
user: Sort of. We made a pact to meet every month for at least one dinner after we all graduated. 
system: That's very sweet. How long have you guys been having this arrangement going? 
user: Give or take the last 8 years. We usually rotate who hosts the gathering every month. The last time I hosted it wasn't that great. 
system: Don't worry. I'm sure they'll enjoy an evening of Chinese cuisine.
