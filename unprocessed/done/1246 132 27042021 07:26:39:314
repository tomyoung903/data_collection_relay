user: Just book it for me that's enough. I hope my best friend enjoys herself. It's her birthday so we're celebrating.
system: Oh that's nice! How old will your best friend be?
user: it will be her sweet 16 birthday. That's why it's a big deal.
system: Well that sounds like an awesome celebration. Would you like me to help you order cake as well?
user: Why that'll be great thank you! My friend likes anything chocolate. If you could get the bakery to deliver it to our hotel room that'll be very nice. 
system: You're very welcome. I've arranged a Truffle cake delivery then.
