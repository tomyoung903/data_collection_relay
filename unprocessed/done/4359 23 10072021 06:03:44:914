user: One of my friends is turning 21 this week! 
system: Congrats to her! Does she have anything special planned? 
user: Actually, a few of us are taking her out of town! It’s too much of a special occasion to spend it in boring old Cambridge.  
system: That’s so sweet. You’re all such great friends.
