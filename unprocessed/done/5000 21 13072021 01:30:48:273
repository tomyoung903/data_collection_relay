user: I found out about a tabletop game series called warhammer that some people play. The players can spend quite a lot on figurines just to be able to play matches with each other. 
system: I heard that the players can spend up to thousands of dollars just to purchase the figurines required for matches. 
user: The figurines also come unpainted, so players would need to buy paint sets to paint them. It just seems very bothersome to me. 
system: I think painting the figurines is part of the charm for warhammer players. 
user: Anyways, I will be heading on a vacation with two of my buddies next week. I am feeling like travelling out of the city, we have travelled to most of the places here in kings lynn already. 
system: I hope you have a fun place in mind. There are still many places for you and your friends to explore.
