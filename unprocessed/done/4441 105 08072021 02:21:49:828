user: What is your favourite day of the week? 
system: None, they are all the same to me. 
user: Wow you must be fun at parties. Wanna guess what's mine? 
system: Hmm I am going to guess it is Saturday? 
user: NAH, that's what most people's favourite days are but not me. 
system: So what is it then? 
user: It's Thursday actually! That is when the break falls on for my job. In fact I am travelling this Thursday! 
system: No wonder it seems a little bit random, I see! It's always about the rest day isn't it
