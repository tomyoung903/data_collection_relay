system: Nothing too fancy, something casual. An example of the dress code for either Thanh Binh or La Margherita could be a t-shirt with shorts.
user: Ok. Do you think it is an acceptable place for a first date?
system: Yup, nothing too underwhelming or overwhelming, with nice ambiance and good service!
user: Sounds good to me!
system: Hope you have a good time!
