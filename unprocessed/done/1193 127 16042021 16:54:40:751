user: Mom called and told me that there was a car crash on the highway to Cambridge today.
system: Oh dear, that sounds terrible!
user: Yes, multiple cars piled up on the highway after a drunk driver drove into the wrong lane.
system: We must really take care to not drink and drive!
user: That highway is really long though, I'd much rather take the train to go to visit Mom. I can't imagine anyone driving all the way there!
system: Have you thought of visiting her?
user: Oh no, I can't make it. 
system: How about inviting her down?
