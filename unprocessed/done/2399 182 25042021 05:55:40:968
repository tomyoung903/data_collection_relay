user: Wow, that's very interesting. I don't know much about Greek architecture or Aristotle's library, but i'm sure it looks very grand. It would be such an experience to read in such an atmosphere.
system: It would be! However, only students are allowed to enter the library. You could still soak up the atmosphere by reading at the nearby cafe with the library in sight.
