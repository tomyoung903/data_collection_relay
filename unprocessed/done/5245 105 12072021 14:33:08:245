user: Oh god this toothache is killing me! I want to bang my head against the wall or something. 
system: Go see a dentist! Even though it is just the teeth it could potentially be a very serious problem! 
user: I know I know, I have already made an appointment but in the mean time I will have to bear with it. 
system: Great! When is the appointment? And perhaps you can try using ice or something to reduce the temperature in the area to soothe the pain. 
user: It is this Sunday. Yeah I think I will try that, god toothaches really suck I never knew it could be this bad. 
system: This will teach you a lesson to take care of your teeth and have proper oral hygiene!
