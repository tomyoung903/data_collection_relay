user: I think I have insurance but I'm not sure if it can cover all this damage. 
system: I'm sorry for what happened. Are you ok? Did anyone get injured? 
user: Luckily there was no injury. 
system: Thank goodness. However I still think you should go to the hospital after settling the dispute just in case. 
user: I should, shouldn't I? We would have flown out the windshield if it weren't for the airbags after all. 
system: Good luck with settling your dispute. Do remember to visit a hospital soon as well.
