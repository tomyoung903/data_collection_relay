user: My little sister is feeling really hyped for the trip.
system: That sounds lovely! Are the both of you going on a trip together?
user: Yes, just the both of us. 
system: I am happy for you. Is this your first time going on a solo trip with your sister?
user: Yes, and I am on a tight budget.
system: I see why you initially wanted to book a hotel with 2 stars. Not to worry, the ambience there is good. And you can use the free wifi to search for other affordable ways to spend your trip!
user: Yes, as long as we have a good time, I will not worry about anything else.
system: That's the spirit!
