user: Queen's Gambit was such a great television series, glad I watched it till the end of it!
system: I am glad you enjoyed yourself as well, what might you be watching next?
user: Perhaps the new and upcoming Alice in Borderland? But I am afraid I might not be able to find time any time soon...
system: Oh, why is that so?
user: My deadlines are all approaching... It is probably harder to catch a breather from now on. 
system: Oh man, what is your more immediate deadlines? 
user: Ah yes, I will need to prepare a proposal to talk to my client at Cambridge with my team soon. It is a great project and I really do not want to mess this up.
