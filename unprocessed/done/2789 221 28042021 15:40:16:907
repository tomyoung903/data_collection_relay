user: I have not been to town for ages man! I'm really excited as I'll be meeting my brother whom I have not seen for 5 years! 
system: Wow! That's long! It must be a long awaited reunion.
user: Yea! He has been so busy he hasn't had time for himself. Now that his project is over, I should give him a treat by bringing him out to do the things he really enjoys.
system: Your brother must enjoy sports and movies then?
user: Yes he does! He used to play basketball and rugby. He also enjoys water sports! He has always enjoyed movies and shows since young too.
system: Wow your brother must really appreciate your thoughtfulness! 
user: I do hope so! Thanks for your help! 
system: No worries! Have a great catchup session with your brother!
