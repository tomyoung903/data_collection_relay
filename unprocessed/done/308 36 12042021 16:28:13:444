system: Hello there. How are you doing? 
user: I couldn't be better. Got up to a pleasant surprise, just heard my relatives will be stopping over nearby. We're going to meet up for lunch or something. 
system: Oh, that's exciting!
user: I know, I'm pumped. It's been so long since we last met. Last time we had a blast at Cambridge. 
system: I'm sure. Will they be here long? 
user: Just over the weekend. Happens that I'm also off this week. 
system: Perfect timing then.
