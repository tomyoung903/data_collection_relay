user: I feel that being in nature is relaxing and it allows me to take a break from my busy schedule.
system: I am sure it does! Punting allows you to have a relaxing ride and enjoy nature in the mean time.
user: I have friends coming along too. Do you think it would be boring for them?
system: I am sure it won't, they can also try punting. It's not a difficult art and they might get the hang of it with enough practice.
user: I hope so, I am scared they won't enjoy it.
system: Don't worry, you can talk to them on the ride too! Just have fun and enjoy the beautiful nature!
