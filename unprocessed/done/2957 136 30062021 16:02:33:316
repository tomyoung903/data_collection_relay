user: The children just learned how to swim and they are bugging me to bring them out to swim. 
system: They will enjoy the pool very much.  
user: I hope they don't drown. 
system: Children can be very playful but I'm sure the safety at the pool should be good. 
user: I hope so. I'm worried. They are very young after all. 
system: You can accompany them on the attractions that allow children entry. That should ease your worry a little!
