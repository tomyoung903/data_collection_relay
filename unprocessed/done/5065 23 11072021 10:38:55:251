user: I was arrowed for an out-of-town work conference. This sucks.  
system: Cheer up! I’m sure it’ll be over soon!  
user: Yeah, at least it’s only a one-day event. Also, I guess there’s some upsides.  
system: Why’s that? 
user: I have the remainder of the week off. Maybe I’ll go do something fun, since I rarely get to leave Birmingham New Street.  
system: That’s the spirit! Things aren’t that bad.
