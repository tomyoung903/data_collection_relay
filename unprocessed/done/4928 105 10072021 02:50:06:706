user: I heard Leicester is holding an international comics conference this week. 
system: Is it? What do they do in such a conference. 
user: I think the big brands usually use it as a platform to promote their stuff, then there are the independent artists who discuss and share their ideas. It is more like a festival actually. 
system: Wow it sounds pretty fun actually! Are you an artist yourself?
