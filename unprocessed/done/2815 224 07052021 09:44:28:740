user: Is walk-in booking for the guest house? I don't want to go there and have nowhere to stay in. It's gonna be annoying to find elsewhere to stay.
system: Nope, strictly no walk-ins. I highly advise that you book the rooms asap if not, you might be disappointed. I can book them for you. I mean, it's free and will make your life easier.
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, ask some more.
