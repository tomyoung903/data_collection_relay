user: Hi! Are you free now? 
system: Of course! I'm always free to help out. 
user: Great. I am moving but I'm so confused with all the options I have. 
system: Don't worry. What are you deciding between? 
user: I need to settle some logistical issues. However, there are just so many factors to consider like the cost, duration and convenience. So yes, it would be nice if you can talk me through this and help me make up my mind.  
system: I see. Don't worry, we can go through this together. What are your plans so far?
