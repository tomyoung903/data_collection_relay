user: Can't wait to have some steamed pork buns again. 
system: I see. What are they? 
user: In my favourite versions, they are bite sized buns with just a small portion of pork meat, and the soup inside just flows out if you bite into one. 
system: Sounds delicious, I will I could try that. 
user: Haha. You know, I suppose I could go for some chinese cuisine. 
system: Why not?
