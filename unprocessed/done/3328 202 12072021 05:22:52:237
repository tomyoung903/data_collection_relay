user: I still haven't decided what to get for my grandfather yet. 
system: Is this a family trip to celebrate your grandfather's birthday? That's a big group you have there. 
user: It is. We are planning it as a surprise for my grandfather.

user: He's quite a fan of the Chinese culture, but I have no idea where to start. 
system: That explains why you chose a Chinese restaurant. Perhaps you can consider getting something small like Chinese tea if he likes it? If he's a collector, you can also add something related to Chinese culture to his collection.
