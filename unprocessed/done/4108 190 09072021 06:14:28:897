user: I am afraid my kid will not be used to sleeping outside of his home! 
system: Is this his first time going on a trip! 
user: It is his second time! He couldn't fall asleep for a long period of time during the first trip and this is why I am worried!  
system: You can bring his favorite stuffed animal or small blanket from home to the hotel room! This will bring a touch of home and hopefully he will be able to fall asleep easier! 
user: I hope he can be able to fall asleep easier with that!  
system: I am sure he can. Getting kids into a great sleep routine will be a challenge for every parent!
