user: It has been a long time since I travelled, the school holidays are coming, and I think this will be a good opportunity for me to take a vacation.
system: Yes, you deserve a good break.
user: 
The previous time I have booked a trip was to go to London by train from Bishops Stanford.
system: Do you have any city in mind and will you be traveling from Bishops Stanford similar to the previous trip?
user: Yes, I am planning a trip to Cambridge on a train from Bishops Stanford. Can you assist me with that?
system: There are many trains on that route. Do you have any specific day or time that you would like to travel or arrive by?
user: Yes, I am looking to travel on Saturday and arrive at 8:00.
system: In that case, I will have only one train that will meet your needs.  Train TR6163 will depart at 05:29 and arrive by 06:07. Would you like me to book you a ticket?
user: I will be able to book the ticket on my own, but it will be great that if you can share the travelling time in minutes with me.
system: The travelling time will be 36 mins. Anything that I can assist you with?
