user: The streets here are really dirty, I expected much more. 
system: Well I think a lot of streets are just not cleaned frequently. 
user: Yeah but people should have the basic courtesy of not littering at least.  Streets in Cambridge are better than this, I hope. 
system: You really expect too much from people aye, it is really hard for them to do the right thing sometimes.  
user: I really hope Cambridge don't disappoint me, I went there before and it was really clean. 
system: Hahaha I wish you the very best.
