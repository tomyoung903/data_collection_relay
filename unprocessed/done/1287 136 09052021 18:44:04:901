user: My family is going on a vacation. It has been a while since we have last gone on a trip together. I'm really looking forward to it!
system: Your family is quite big. 8 people?
user: Yes! My younger children are still very young. It will be difficult trying to take care of all 8 people at once.
system: That's tough. Children tend to be very active at a young age. I think they may find interest in the church.
user: I hope so. They have been glued to their phones all day lately.
system: Then the free internet at the hotel can help occupy them easily! That would distract them enough.
user: I would love it if they would put their phones away for once though. It was so difficult to gather everyone for a trip after all.
system: Don't worry and just enjoy yourself!
