user: Oh whew that's a relief. I've been seeing lots of gang related activities in the news, so I want to make sure me and my family are safe.
system: Yes it's terrible news isn't it? Luckily for most of us trouble doesn't come knocking if we don't look for it.
user: Yes I hope so. But at least I feel safer now knowing where the police station is.
system: No worries, I would too. The last gang activity that happened in Cambridge was 3 months ago, so statistically speaking the odds are in your favour.
