user: i've been robbed! 
system: oh dear. do you still remember how the robber looks like? 
user: i think i still have a slight recollection from when he bumped into me awhile ago. i should have checked my belongings just now! 
system: don't beat yourself up over it, just hurry to parkside and inform the police. you might still have a chance to get back your valuables.
