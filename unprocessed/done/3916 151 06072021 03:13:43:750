user: Appreciate it. Turns out my cousin was just hospitalised. 
system: Oh no. What happened? 
user: I'm not sure. For the past few days, he had been complaining about back pain. 
system: He didn't go to the doctor earlier? 
user: No, he's as stubborn as a mule. He kept saying he was fine and alright. 
system: Then? 
user: One of his friends called me and said my cousin was now using a wheelchair to move around as his leg was hurting too. 
system: Did he finally get it checked? 
user: Nope. I had to tell his friend to get him to the hospital. They talked to the doctor and he was immediately rushed to the surgery room. 
system: That's terrible. Does the friend have any info? 
user: I hope so. I've been trying to call him, but it goes straight to voicemail. 
system: He might be busy. Get there asap. I'm sure the hospital has answers.
