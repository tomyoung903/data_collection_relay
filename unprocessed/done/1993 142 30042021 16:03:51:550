user: I’ll be dining with my family tonight.
system: I see, do you see them frequently?
user: Not as much since I moved out, and I don’t talk to them as much now.
system: That doesn’t sound good.
user: Yes, which is why these meals are important for me, so I get to talk to them and we still stay in each other’s lives.
system: That sounds good, any ideas for what to do after dinner?
user: I was hoping for something light, since it'll be just after dinner. But I don't really have any ideas as of now.
system: What does your family like to do?
user: They aren't really into anything physical, so maybe we could just take a walk around the city.
system: That sounds like a good plan.
