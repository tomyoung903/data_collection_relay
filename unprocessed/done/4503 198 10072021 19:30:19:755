user: Well done. I love you! 
system: Not a problem at all! Although, I do have one question I'm curious about.  
user: Ask away. 
system: How are you going there by train but still need parking? 
user: I will be renting a car when I get there. 
system: Oh, alright. Why not rent a car and drive there. 
user: It's too far away. I need my sleep, and the fact that I cannot, for the life of me, focus for long periods of time. 
system: Understandable.
