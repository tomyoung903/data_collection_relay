system: You need to be cautious. Many of them are scams. 
user: That seems to make sense, if a person had found a secret or novel method to earn money they wouldn't be inclined to share it with people unless it is a scam. 
system: It is good to be discerning to avoid falling into traps. 
user: I will be going to London Kings Cross next week. I am going to give a seminar on scams to inform the public on how to identify them. 
system: Wonderful! You are helping others to avoid scams!
