user: My kid just told me she wants to be a professor when she grows up. 
system: That great isn't it! Though I am sure it will be tough. 
user: HAHAHA I am sure it is very tough, but it is interesting that she brought up such a unique career instead of common ones like teacher, police and all. 
system: Do you talk to her about academics a lot? 
user: No I don't think so? She's a fervent reader so she probably read about it somewhere or on TV. 
system: Well you have to give her your full support aye. 
user: Indeed, I am planning to take her to see a college so she knows how her future 'work environment' is like. 
system: Hahaha that sounds like a brilliant idea.
