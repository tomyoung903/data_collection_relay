user: My kid told me before that he doesn’t like to host a birthday party! 
system: Is there a reason why? 
user: He is afraid that there will be no one attending his party. 
system: I am sure that won’t be the case. You can host a birthday party at the funhouse and invite his friends over.  
user: I am not sure if he will like it. 
system: I think he will. It will be a surprise for him!
