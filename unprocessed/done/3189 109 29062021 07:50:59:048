user: The birdwatching club is having their anniversary! 
system: How many years? 
user: Six! Unfortunately, I've been made in charge of the planning of the day's celebrations. 
system: Surely that gives you greater control. 
user: But I can't disappoint them. It'll have to be at Cambridge. Anything else is either a repeat event, or too expensive. 
system: I suggest something related to the birds. It is a shared interest amongst you all, by the looks of it.
