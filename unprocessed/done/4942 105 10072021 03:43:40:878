user: Asian noodles are so good, I am not saying that western sphagetti and stuff is bad but hey it is really good. 
system: What really differentiates them? Is it the texture or taste or what. 
user: I would say it is more of the texture. And also the way they cook it, I think it is processed in a very different way. 
system: Right, but how did you come to realise that suddenly. 
user: I am at dojo noodle bar. And their noodles are really good haha. 
system: Wow thanks for telling me. Now I know where to get noodles from.
