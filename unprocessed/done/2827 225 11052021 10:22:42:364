user: are you sure?
system: I can't say anything for sure, but it will be good if you can order some Chinese cuisines
user: yea...right, but I am afraid that it will not be authentic enough for them!
system: I mean, for an expensive restaurant, they should have pretty high level of food quality, don't worry!
user: Alright, got that! Thanks
system: Alls good!
