user: My kids love game night!  
system: What do you and your family normally play? 
user: We play video games together but we can't bring them out on a trip with us. They are too bulky. 
system: That's unfortunate. I am sure that there are other ways to entertain your kids too!  
user: I am not sure if they can enjoy without gaming. 
system: I suggest that you can play some classic board games like Monopoly during your stay at the hotel. All of you can play together too!
