user: This is my first time in Cambridge and the campus is huge ! 
system: Welcome to Cambridge ! What are you here for ? 
user: I am actually meeting up with a friend who studies here, and she is going to bring me around town while we hang out. 
system: It is very nice of your friend to be your guide during your visit here. 
user: Unfortunately I got lost while trying to make my way to our meeting spot.  
system: That sounds like trouble. Have you tried looking up your destination ? 
user: Yeah, we are supposed to meet up at the Fitzwilliam Museum. I tried to make my way there, but I got lost. 
system: Since this is your first time here, it is natural to be lost when navigating the place.
