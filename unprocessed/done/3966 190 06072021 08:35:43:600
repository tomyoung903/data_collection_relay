user: It's been raining heavily recently. I hope this trip is not going to be a wasted one for me and my friends! 
system: I am sure it won't! There is a lot of stuff to do together in the hotel room when you are stuck in a hotel due to rainy weather!  
user: Wet weather really kills the mood. We have lots of outdoor activities planned! 
system: That's going to be unfortunate. I feel that as long as all of you are together as one, it will still be a memorable trip!
