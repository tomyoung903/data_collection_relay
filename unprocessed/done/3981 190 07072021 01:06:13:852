user: I want to get a feel of how is it like travelling by myself.  
system: That’s a great idea! You don’t have to worry if the people you dine in with like the food that you choose. You can also eat the food in the restaurant at your own pace! 
user: I agree, I don’t have to take into consideration of the others! 
system: When you travel with others, your activities are planned so that they will enjoy themselves. If they don’t, you might feel guilty for ruining their trip. You won’t get that when travelling alone!  
user: I am just skeptical of my decision to travel alone.  
system: Travelling alone builds confidence in yourself too!
