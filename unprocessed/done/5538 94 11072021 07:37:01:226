user: My wife has been craving for some restaurant food lately. Guess she's tired of my cooking. 
system: Well, too much of a good thing can be bad. 
user: It has been a really long time since we ate out, I admit. I should bring her out for dinner this week. 
system: That sounds nice. I'm sure your wife will be pleased. 
user: She went to De Luca Cucina and bar with her friends some time ago. She has been begging me to bring her there ever since.
