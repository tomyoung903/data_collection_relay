user: Haha, my friends and I plan to shoot a video about the cheap hotel you just recommended. And we plan to start a youtube channel.
system: That's not a bad idea. However, don't forget to adhere to the rules and regulations of the hotel while you are filming the video.
user: I know that, can i ask for your help if I ran out of ideas for my videos? Haha.
system: No problem my friend. I wish you all the best!
