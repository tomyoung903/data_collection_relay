user: What do you think is something iconic about Europe.
system: The catherals hands down.
user: Guess what, I am in a catheral city right now.
system: Wow! Where would that be? You are so fortunate to be able to see those beautiful architectures everyday.
user: I'm in Ely! Honestly you just get used to it after a while and it doesn't feel as impressive anymore.
system: Who knows, maybe you will start missing it when you go away to another place next time.
user: Don't be ridiculous, they have cathedrals all over Europe, I am travelling to Cambridge and guess what, they have cathedrals there as well.
system: Okay, that's a fair point. I will concede that.
