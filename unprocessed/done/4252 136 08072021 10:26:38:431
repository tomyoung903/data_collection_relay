user: I hope the trip is worth it. My aunt has expensive tastes and she will complain until no tomorrow if she is not happy. 
system: That sounds rough. The hotel shouldn't be too bad. 
user: Hopefully. If she starts complaining, she will spoil everyone's mood. 
system: Maybe stay in a different room than her? 
user: That's a good idea. It would be a waste if everyone cannot enjoy themselves after all that planning. 
system: Don't worry too much! I'm sure she will enjoy the hotel.
