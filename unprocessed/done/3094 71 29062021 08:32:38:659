user: I hope it doesn't rain on the way back. 
system: Why would you say that, friend? 
user: It is just that I will be carrying many boxes, and rain will just make it so much more troublesome! 
system: Relax friend, I can see from the weather forecast that it will not rain. 
user: That's great! I will be carrying all my things to Cambridge, so that is trouble enough already. 
system: Maybe making early bookings for your way back will lighten your load even further?
