system: Wow, did you eat something wrong?
user: I am not sure, perhaps it was the breakfast my mum made for me this morning. I knew it tasted a little weird! 
system: That is unfortunate, I hope you feel better soon! How was breakfast with your family though? 
user: It was great for the three of us! We were talking about taking a trip out of Cambridge together as a family. It will be a time for them to finally take a break!
system: That sounds great! Any idea on how you going to have it?
