user: Can't wait to go to Germany. I've been looking forward to this trip for weeks. I have not visited my grandparents for a few months.
system: That sounds wonderful. It is always good to reconnect to your roots. How will you be going there?
user: Yes, I can't wait. I think my nieces will also be in town when I'm there. I haven't seen them since they were born in the hospital. Oh, I will take the 830 flight from stansted airport in two weeks' time. 
system: I see. That sounds fun! Is there still any planning left to do?
