user: The subway is getting noisier and dirtier every day! 
system: Is it? What do you think might be the cause of it? 
user: I really feel that it is all the immigrants that is creating this mess for us. 
system: What? That's really xenophobic you know, you can't just generalise an entire group of people. 
user: Yeah say what you want but I can see things with my own eyes, and I think my statement holds some truth in it. 
system: Of course it does because there are bad people in every group. You could also say the locals are the one making this mess. 
user: Now you are just arguing for the sake of it. If you don't believe me, just wait for this TV special airing on Tuesday, it is a documentary about the immigrant situation in this country. 
system: Sure, but I am sure the TV programme is not a smear campaign on an entire group of people.
