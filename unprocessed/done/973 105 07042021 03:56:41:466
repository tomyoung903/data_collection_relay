user: I kind of miss my family.
system: How long have you been away from them for?
user: Almost a whole year now since I came to Cambridge to pursue my studies.
system: I am so sorry to hear about that, why didn't you go back and visit them?
user: Let's just say that we didn't part on good terms, and I'm really not sure if I should go back.
system: They are your family after all. I'm sure they are putting these things past them and their love for you is much stronger. Drop back for a visit if you can.
