user: Great. I'm having some maintenance done at my home. 
system: Everything alright at home? 
user: Yeah. Just some parts are getting old so we are just renovating it. 
system: Ah, I see. Are the old things bothering you? 
user: Hahaha. Nope, not at all. But my wife is insistent on getting us renovated. 
system: Why is that? 
user: Who knows. She probably went to one of her friend's homes and got inspired. 
system: I see. That's pretty sudden. 
user: Pretty sudden and very expensive. But you know what they say, happy wife happy life. 
system: The house is a good choice then.
