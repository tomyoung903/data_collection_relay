user: Actually, what's your take on food ideas for a first date?
system: I'm not sure. Everyone has their own preference and it's difficult to cater to everyone.
user: Okay that's true. Forget that I asked.
system: I'm kidding. But people do say Anatolia is decent, so you can tell me how it went after your date.
user: That's great. I'm hoping she likes the place. Wish me luck!
system: All the best!
