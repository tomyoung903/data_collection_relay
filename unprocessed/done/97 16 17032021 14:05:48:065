user: Hi there! I’m looking to bring my girlfriend on a date to somewhere nice.
system: That’s super cute! What ideas do you currently have?
user: I’m all out of ideas! I used all my ideas for our previous dates and now I’m clueless.
system: Not to worry, I’m sure we’ll figure something out! Where have you two not been to yet?
user: Well... I think we’ve not gone to a museum before.
system: That sounds like an awesome idea! Around which area would be good for you?
