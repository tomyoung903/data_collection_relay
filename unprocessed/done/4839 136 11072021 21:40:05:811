user: I should invite my friend along. She's doing some art project but seems stuck at something. 
system: I think visiting the museum can help give her some inspiration to continue her art project. 
user: That's true. I didn't really think of that! I only wanted to bring her because I thought she could relieve some stress by coming out of her studio. 
system: That too. It's also a good thing that entrance is free too. 
user: Yes! I'm going to call her now. 
system: You are a good friend. Have fun at the museum!
