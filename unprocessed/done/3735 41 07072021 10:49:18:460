user: My friends and I are planning to go on a staycation. 
system: That's nice. Staycations are great for relaxing and recharging ourselves. 
user: Yes, not to mention it is also convenient and affordable. Could you recommend some activities to do during the staycation? 
system: If you're an outdoor person, you could go to the beach or even go camping. Otherwise, visiting local tourist spots would be fun too. 
user: Camping sounds like a good idea. I better go pack all the necessary items before Sunday! 
system: Good luck and have fun!
