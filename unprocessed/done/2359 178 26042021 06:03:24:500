user: I am often confused by the difference between a 4-star hotel and a 5-star hotel.
system: Which part confuses you?
user: I think a 4-star hotel is just fine comparing to a 5-star hotel, but I guess rich people don't care that much.
system: Yes, that is one of the good things about being rich: you can always choose the one with best service.
