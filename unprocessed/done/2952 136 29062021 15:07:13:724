user: I'm enrolling in college soon. Hopefully I can get into a central one so that I can stay closer to my grandmother.  
system: It's good to stay near a family member. 
user: Yes! The free entrance is great too since I'm a broke student haha. 
system: That's great! You can visit your grandmother while you are there as well. Maybe bring her along with you to tour the college? 
user: I should. She should go out more often for exercise. 
system: The elderly should exercise more. Hope you enjoy your tour around the college!
