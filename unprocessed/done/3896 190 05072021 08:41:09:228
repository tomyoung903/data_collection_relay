user: I feel that China is a place where everything boggles the imagination. 
system: It definitely is. By tradition, the Chinese eat with the help of wooden chopsticks. You can definitely have a try of it later at the Chinese restaurant. 
user: That's a very interesting way of eating. I have never used the chopsticks before! 
system: You will definitely be able to get used to it! It will be hard at the start but once you are used to it, you will be fine!
