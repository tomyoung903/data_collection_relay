user: Wow! That sounds convenient, what if I am not able to get a ride through the app?
system: There are a few services with good reviews. Would you like to have them? I could give you the number now, or you could ask it from me when you need it.
user: It is alright, I should be able to get a few off Google.  Hopefully, the weather will be good.
system: I am sure there will be nice places for you to sit and wait until the rain stops if you do not want to call a cab. I shall wish for dry and wonderful weather when you are out on your trip!
