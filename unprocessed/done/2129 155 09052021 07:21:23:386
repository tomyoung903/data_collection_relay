user: It is my first date and I'm quite nervous. What should I wear?
system: You should wear something that represents yourself! Since they are cheap restaurants, you wouldn't want to overdress though.
user: Ok. Do you think it is an acceptable place for a first date?
system: It's quite subjective, but what matters is the company and the enjoyment between the two of you.
user: Sounds good to me! Wish me luck.
system: Good luck! Hope you have a great time.
