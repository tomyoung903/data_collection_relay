user: Honestly, it's great that 4-star hotels can be affordable too. It's so difficult to find good accommodation nowadays. I hope my family enjoys the trip. 
system: It does seem like price points are high for quality hotels. It's a part and parcel of globalization. Higher demand means higher costs. Anyway, have a wonderful family trip!
