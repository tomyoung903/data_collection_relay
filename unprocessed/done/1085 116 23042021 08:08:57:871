user: Valerie just invited me to the party of the year!
system: Wow that's exciting, who else is going?
user: She invited me and James but I'm sure there will be others.
system: Cool, hope you have fun!
user: I definitely will, I heard the place even has a private pool!
system: You are making me jealous, I want to go too...
user: haha I'll need to pick an outfit for the night too, I wonder what I should wear!
system: Maybe something comfortable but also pops so that you can be the star of the night!
user: Sounds like a good idea, I'll need to plan for transport as well, maybe I'll call a taxi.
system: Should I book one for you?
