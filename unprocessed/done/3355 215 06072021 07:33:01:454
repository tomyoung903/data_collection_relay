user: my family love noodles, this sounds like a good option! are the food spicy though? my younger siblings can't take spicy food. 
system: there are many choices in Yippee Noodle Bar, I think your siblings will be able to find one that suits them. 
user: that's relieving. oh, i also wanted to asking about parking fee. is it free, or is there an hourly fee? 
system: yes, parking is free. Are you taking your family shopping in town after lunch? 
user: indeed. it has been quite long since we've been out on a shopping trip, I wanted to get my parents some presents. 
system: that's really sweet of you. I'm sure your parents are very proud of you.
