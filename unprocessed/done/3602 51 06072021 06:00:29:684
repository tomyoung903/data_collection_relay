user: Today has gone pretty badly for us. 
system: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? 
user: I haven't received a refund from the hotel which has just cancelled our reservation at the last minute. How irresponsible! 
system: That seems unfair, I'm sorry that you have encountered an inconvenience like this. 
user: We're forced to change our plans. Fortunately, there's a few places here at Leicester to stay at, but we'll have to leave after a couple of nights. 
system: I see.
