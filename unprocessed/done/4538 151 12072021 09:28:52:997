user: Nice. I'm getting a few roommates together to buy a home. 
system: Damn. Why are you guys buying a home? 
user: Well, we all just finished our final year in university and have decided we won't be staying with our parents anymore. 
system: Why not? 
user: Well, there is the obvious fact that there is lesser flexibility, but some of my friends don't have family here and others have homes too far from their workplace. 
system: So you guys have found the perfect middle ground already? 
user: Yeah. We have more or less finalised everything and have the deposit ready. We just need to go and sign the final contract. It requires all of us so we are bunking together for a while. 
system: Hence the room reservation.  Why did you guys decide to buy and not rent? 
user: Well, all of us had some good money saved over our 4 years in university. Plus, it made sense to buy a home. We could always rent our share out if we decided to move out.  
system: I see. That makes sense. A home divided 8 ways? Must be a really big home.
