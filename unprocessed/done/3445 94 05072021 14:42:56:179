user: This sounds crazy, but I am bringing along 6 of my friends to Sight-See in Cambridge. 
system: That is quite a crowd. How did you invite so many people ? 
user: I did not ! I was only talking to a friend about a trip, but word somehow got around and now I am handling 6 friends on the trip. 
system: Well, the more the merrier, as they say. 
user: It will be difficult for me to come up with an itinerary for 7 people in Cambridge.  
system: You can ask your friends for their opinions when planning an itinerary. 
user: Hopefully we can find something new to do and see that cannot be found here in Leicester. 
system: I am sure there is no shortage of interesting places to visit in that place.
