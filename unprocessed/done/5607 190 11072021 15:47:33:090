user: I am quite moody recently. 
system: What happened to you? 
user: I quarreled with my family a few days back! 
system: That's sad. You can use the free wifi to listen to some songs. Music will be a great mood lifter!  
user: I hope that will help me. 
system: I am sure it would! You can invite some friends over to the guesthouse to accompany you and hear you out!
