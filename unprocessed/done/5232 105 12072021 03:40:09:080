user: They should really renovate the old buildings here in Cambridge, I am rather concerned. 
system: It is a rather old town right, are you more concerned about the aesthetics or? 
user: the aesthetics are perfectly fine, in fact I like the antique vibes. It is really the safety that I am concerned about! 
system: Ah true, after all some buildings have been around for a very long time, but I am sure the local government keeps them in check? 
user: I am not really sure really, I have been here for years and I have never seen any kind of reinforcement work or checks ever taking place. 
system: Damn, perhaps you should raise this up, it could be a real problem
