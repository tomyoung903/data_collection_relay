user: I'm going to pass my partner a small gift at the end of the stay. Do you think a watch is a good gift?
system: I'm pretty sure they would love any gift from a loved one. Which kind did you get?
user: It was from a watchmaker that my father recommended. 100% original.

system: Good luck for your hide-and-seek.
