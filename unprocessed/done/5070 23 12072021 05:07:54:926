user: I’m meeting some old college friends this weekend! 
system: That’s great! What do you have planned? 
user: We’re gonna wonder around Cambridge and hang out! But I think I’ll probably be late to the gathering.  
system: Sounds fun! Why would you be late though! 
user: My boss wants me to drop by our office in Birmingham New Street to settle something. What a slave-driver.  
system: That’s too bad, but at least you’ll get to have some fun once you’re done!
