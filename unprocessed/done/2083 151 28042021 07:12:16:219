user: It's been quite a long week, hasn't it?
system: Oh, I would never know. For me, the length of a week is determined by the number of seconds in a week. 
user: Of course, it hasn't been a long week for you. I was saying it was quite a long week for me.
system: Would you like to take a break? I have some excellent relaxing spa recommendations.
user: Spas? Hmm, that sounds interesting! Maybe I might want to go for a retreat. 
system: Really want to "treat" yourself this time don't you?
user: Hahaha. That was a good one. But yeah a retreat does sound pretty nice. Spa's are overpriced anyway.
system: Well, according to my database it costs more to go for a retreat than for a relaxing spa. Unless you want to take a break for a few days, in that case, a retreat/hotel would make sense.
