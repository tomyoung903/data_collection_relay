user: Great, I can't wait to spend my time fascinated by the intriguing facts found in the museum.  
system: That's right! Museums are the perfect place to store precious memories of the past for the future to appreciate! 
user: Yeah, museums are like a shared time capsule that is available for all to embrace the past and to anticipate the future. 
system: Talking about time capsule, if you were given a chance to travel through time, would you want to travel to the past or the future? 
user: If I were given the opportunity, I would definitely return to the past to change my past! But since that's impossible, I'll learn from my past to make my present a better past for my future self! 
system: That's motivating to hear! I'm glad you're not too fixated on the concept of staying in the past but continue on to look ahead and head towards the future!
