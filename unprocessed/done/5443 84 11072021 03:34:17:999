user: Jason introduced me to Portuguese food recently. 
system: What did you try? 
user: We tried some milho frito at an international food fair. 
system: How did it taste? 
user: It tasted pretty good! Light and chewy, we had it as a snack to munch on as we went around trying other food. 
system: Did you like any other food at the fair? 
user: Not really, so that's why we're exploring deeper into portuguese dishes. 
system: Learning about other cultures can be really fun!
