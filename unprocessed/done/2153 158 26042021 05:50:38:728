user: West is soooo boring!!!! I wanna have fun in East!!! Do u have any suggestions?
system: Err... I used to go to Cherry Hinton Hall and swam there.
user: Oh man, thats sounds great. How did u go there? I wanna drive my car, but I am afraid there is no free parking. 
system: I walked there, because I live in east, haha. No, u cant park your car without paying. These year is becoming harder and harder to find a place where you dont have to pay. 
user: Uhhh, okay. I want to be in Utopia :"(
system: Sleep well. Dont make day dream bro.
