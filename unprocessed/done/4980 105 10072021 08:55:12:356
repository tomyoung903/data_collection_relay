user: I just brought my date to a play here in Peterborough, but it seems like she didn't really enjoy it. 
system: Oh man, did you ask her about what she wanted to do beforehand? 
user: No I didn't :( I really just thought most girls would like things like theatres and stuff. 
system: Well you really need to put in more effort then, different people can be really different.
