user: I really don't understand how people can sit through romance movies. 
system: Hey to each his own. Different preferences and you just got to respect that. 
user: I mean I do I just get really confused, like how do you do that, it is so boring. 
system: How is it boring, two people falling in love and overcoming obstacles and be together is really sweet. 
user: Yeah except you know that they are gonna be together, or one of them has some terminal illness, doesn't even end any other way. 
system: Okay then what is your supposed interesting and cool and fun genre then Mr Smartiepants. 
user: Hey don't be like that. I am really into mystery movies, talking about that.  I think there is a sherlock holmes movie coming up and I want to catch it at the cinema. 
system: Sure, I guess it does fit your idea of "not knowing what the ending will be" since the culprit doesn't get revealed.
