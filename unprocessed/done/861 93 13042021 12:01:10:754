user: I can't wait for this week to be over.
system: Why would you want this week to be over faster?
user: I am meeting a client at Kings Lynn. Might need to stay around the area with him for the week too.
system: What will you do during your free time there?
user: I am not sure, I will be going alone.
system: I would love to recommend to you some things to do when you are free in that area. If you do not wish to go anywhere I am free to chat too.
user: I would love that! My boss would never allow me to claim any expenses if I brought my partner over. It would be so lonely without anyone.
system: I am sorry that you and your partner have to be separated for a week.
