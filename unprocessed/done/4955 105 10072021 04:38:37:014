user: God I really hate Mondays, can't we skip it honestly. 
system: HAHAHA you hate it because it is the first of the working week isn't it. Everyone hates it. 
user: Yeah and next Monday I have to travel out for a business trip that will last two weeks this is depressing. 
system: I hope you get leave compensations? Or else it should be illegal right.
