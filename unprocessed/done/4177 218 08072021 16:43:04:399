user: My friends and I are going to swim together. But, I don't really know how to swim. 
system: Maybe you can ask your friends to teach you. I believe that places are safe enough for you to learn to swim there. 
user: Hopefully, they will not laugh at me during the learning process. 
system: I believe they wouldn't. And I believe your skill in swimming will surpass them very soon. 
user: I hope so. I hope I can master this skill after this swimming session. And I also hope we could have fill in our stomachs after this exhausting event. 
system: I believe you can! As long as you are willing to learn. I believe the meals there will never let you down!
