user: My mom just called me to go back home for some urgent matters. 
system: Oh no, I hope everything is okay. 
user: Yeah they are probably fine, honestly what can even go wrong when you stay in Cambridge. 
system: Wow why do you sound so relaxed, I thought you would at least be a bit more concerned. 
user: Because she has been using this trick on me countless times and I have already seen through her. 
system: Hahaha I see, no wonder you are so calm, so what did she make you do actually. 
user: She makes me go on blind dates. 
system: Damn and you are still going to go back this time knowing that it is a trap.
