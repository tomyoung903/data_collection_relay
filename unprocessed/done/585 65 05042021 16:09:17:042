user: Hi, I am planning my visit to England. I'm going to be there by 12 noon once my plane from Korea arrives
system: That's wonderful. Can I know more about what you would like to get from your trip? There are a lot of beautiful places to visit and unforgettable things to experience
user: Well I am currently a high school student. I am interested in going to Cambridge for my higher education. I have heard remarkable things from my parents' friends about it.
system: That is certainly true. It is a good place to study. It will also imbue you with an academic culture that is unique to it. 
user: Yes. I definitely intend to drop by to have a quick visit. However, I will not be staying anywhere near there so I would have to plan ahead.
system: Understandable, I heard there are better hotels elsewhere. There are also other must see places around the country after all. Do you need anything else? Maybe you want some recommendations?
