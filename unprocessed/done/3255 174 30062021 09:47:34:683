user: I thought that the travel time would be longer than this to watch both my movie and read a book on the journey. Do you have any suggestions on which I should do? 
system: You should choose the one that you prefer doing more to make the most of your commute! If you're tied for choices, you may look out the window if you happen to take the window seat - it's an amazing experience nonetheless.
