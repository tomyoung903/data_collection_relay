user: I can finally see my girlfriend this weekend! 
system: That’s great!  
user: I’m so excited to see her! It’s been so long since we’ve had time for each other.  
system: Why’s that? 
user: We’re both pretty busy with our jobs. Also, the fact that she lives all the way in Bishops Stortford doesn’t help.  
system: It’s great that you’ll be able to see her this weekend then!
