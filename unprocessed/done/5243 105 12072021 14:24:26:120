user: I can't believe that the first time my husband left Cambridge was when he was 18. 
system: Why not? Don't a lot of people grow up in one place? 
user: Yes but he literally never travelled out, and this town is literally tiny! 
system: Well it is crucial to understand that not everyone is privileged enough to go out as well you know. 
user: That is fair. But I am here visiting his family and they definitely seem very well off, at least to travel, to me. 
system: Have you asked him why then? It is indeed slightly odd that people who can afford to don't travel.
