user: I really prefer to stay in a 2 star hotel near the city center. I'll only be staying for a night and I need to head on to my convocation tomorrow, so my room need not be too fancy as I'm short on cash lately.
system: I see, that explains why the 2 star hotels near your desired locations have all been booked. They must have been packed due to the convocation! Anyways, I will continue to search for more hotels that fit your needs and I'll notify you soon
