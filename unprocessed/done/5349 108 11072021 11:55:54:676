user: I recently came back from a vacation in Morocco. 
system: How was it? 
user: It would have been great if I did not go with my wife. 
system: Oh no, what did she do? 
user: Well, she refused to eat any Moroccan food. We had to find dimsum restaurants even though I wanted to try it so badly. 
system: That sounds like quite the hassle.
