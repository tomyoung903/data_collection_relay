user: Do you think I'm spending too much on this?
system: Well, as long as you have financial stability, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't splurge once in a while.
user: That's right! That's what I keep telling my friends. They're too frugal.
system: Though thriftiness has its own advantages, life is all about being happy. If you constantly worry about how much you're spending, are you truly living life at all?
user: I completely agree. Going on a holiday like this, I do get lonely sometimes though. 
system: Oh, are you going alone? Do you have the one whole room to yourself?
user: Yes, forever alone.
system: No worries. It is always nice to have some alone time. Treat this as a self-care holiday! Get to know yourself better through this trip.
user: Yes, I will.
system: That's great!
