user: I took a train from the central station a few weeks ago. It was hell.
system: Oh? What happened?
user: It was so crowded. I got elbowed thrice.
system: That sounds rough. The station can get quite crowded given its location.
user: Precisely. This time, I'll be departing from the Birmingham new street location.
system: Hopefully, it won't be crowded. Can I help you with anything?
