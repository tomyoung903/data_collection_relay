user: Great. I'm attending a concert over the weekend.  
system: Amazing. Who is the main attraction? 
user: The queen herself, Lady Gaga. 
system: Nice.  
user: No. It's really nice. I had to wait hours on the online portal to get even a single ticket. 
system: Oh, that is terrible.  
user: Yeah. And extremely expensive getting 7 tickets. My bank balance is almost empty. 
system: Good thing you are staying in a cheap hotel then. Let's hope Lady Gaga is worth it!
