user: Hi, it's been such a hassle organising this trip. It seems like there's more and more to do everyday.
system: Hello, that does not sound good. What's causing you problems now?
user: Well, aside from all the administrative issues that I have to handle. I also need to find train tickets for Wednesday. There are just so many options to choose from and the scheduling is quite complicated.
system: That is true, we have a very complex system to manage all our trains. But do not worry! I can assist you, what would you like to know?
