user: It's alright. One of my friend's mentioned he may get tickets to the League Cup final. 
system: Sounds exciting. Who are the finalists? 
user: Manchester United and an unexpected Bournemouth.  
system: Why is Bournemouth so unexpected? 
user: They are like a league below United. Their players cost under 10% of United. And along the way, they have beaten so many top tier teams. 
system: So it's like a David vs Goliath match? 
user: Yes, and everyone non-United supporter is rooting for them. 
system: Everyone loves underdogs. 
user: I can't wait to watch the match live. It's going to be so fun and I'm really hoping Bournemouth wins. 
system: Hopefully so. You just get to watch the match live or are there any other perks? 
user: Depending on what tickets my friend get's we could get free snacks to behind the scenes views of the stadium. Either way, it's going to be a long and tiring but nonetheless exciting few days. 
system: Good thing you'll have a comfortable place to stay then.
