user: I am going to bring some foreign students around town this week. 
system: That sounds fun ! Where will you be bringing them ?  
user: I will be bringing them around London. I heard that they have not went anywhere outside of our university since they came here. 
system: Why is that so ? 
user: Well, we've been busy studying all semester, so I wouldn't be surprised if the students have no reason to explore outside our campus at Cambridge. 
system: That's sounds tough. I hope they will get a fun break on the trip.
