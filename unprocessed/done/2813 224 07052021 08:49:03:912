user: Wait. How far is old schools from the hotel? Can I go there easily?
system: Don't worry! It's so near you can actually walk from the hotel. It'll only take at most 12 minutes.
user: Hm, ok. That's about it. 
system: Be prepared to be gobsmacked by the awesome sceneries during your walk! Stay safe.
