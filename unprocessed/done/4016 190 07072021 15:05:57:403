system: You can create a video at the hotel room when you have time. The content can be up to your imagination!  
user: I will find time to do that. It's hard to think of content. I am scared that my viewers won't like it. 
system: Do not worry! I am sure that there will be viewers that will truthfully enjoy what you post!
