user: I saw a youtube video recently about geese on Staten Island. Apparently the ones there can be quite friendly. 
system: They can also be quite frightening too if they get agitated. 
user: Indeed, but animals are nice to watch nonetheless. I heard Wandlebury has parks which are quite interesting. 
system: They certainly are, the parks also have wildlife that you can observe while you are there.
