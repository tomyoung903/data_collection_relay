user: My sister's kids are so noisy and they cry all the time.  
system: How many kids does she have? 
user: She has twins. They are 2 years old. 
system: That is a very cute age. 
user: Yes that is also true. They have very tiny hands and feet and they look like angels when they sleep. I am going to miss them so much when I go back home. 
system: Maybe you could stay at her place for a few more days. 
user: I wish I could do that but I had come to Cambridge for Christmas and now I have to get back to work.  
system: I bet you will miss the noise too.
