user: I'll be going on my first business trip out of the city next week. 
system: How do you feel? 
user: Slightly nervous, but I'm mostly excited. It'll be at stevenage, and I have friends who live there. They offered me to stay at their places while we catch up. Should I? 
system: It does sound like an opportune moment to catch up with them. If you want to, why not? 
user: You're right, I see no reason not to. It's been a while since I've left cambridge, so I'm excited to go through different experiences outside the city. 
system: I hope that you'll enjoy yourself.
