user: Yes please. I just broke up with my boyfriend and I want to distract myself from it.
system: I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to join a guided tour to help take your mind off things?
user: Sure that's a good idea. Talking to people would help. 
system: Yes it would for sure. The scenery might be a welcome change for you too.
user: Hopefully. Do you know how long it takes to heal a broken heart?
system: I'm sure it hurts now, but don't you worry, time heals all wounds.
