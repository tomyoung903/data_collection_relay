user: My friends and I love singing a lot!  
system: That's nice. Do all of you sing together often? 
user: Not really, we don't have time to meet up most of the time. 
system: I suggest you can do a karaoke session at the house during your stay! Make sure not to sing too late as it will disturb your neighbors!
