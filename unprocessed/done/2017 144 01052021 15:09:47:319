user: We are not just allowed to dine for 15 minutes right? That is too short!
system: Oh no no no, that is not what I meant! Allow me to rephrase. Come early and you can enjoy the food at your own pace. 
user: Oh, I see. Another question, is there any way of going around the area? Just in case I have travel plans, you know when I want to walk around and do something instead of staying in for the whole period. It would be quite boring. 
system: No worries! You can always use ride-hailing apps with the free wifi!
