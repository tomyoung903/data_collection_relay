user: I'm meeting up with my ex-project members. It's been a while since I last saw them. 
system: I see. 7 is quite a big group for a project. What was the project about? 
user: It was a competition actually. We teamed up to build a robot and came in third place. That was three years ago. 
system: That's interesting. It's also amazing that you and your members are still in contact with each other. 
user: I wasn't expecting to be able to make such great friends through the competition too. We now hold meetups annually. 
system: Nothing is better than meeting up for a good meal. 
user: That's indeed one thing I look forward to each time! 
system: Enjoy the Asian food this round. Maybe you and your members can go for North American food next year. 
user: Definitely! There's always a chance for that in the future. 
system: Have a nice meal!
