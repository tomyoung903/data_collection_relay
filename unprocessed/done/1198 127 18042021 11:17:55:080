user: My sister's celebrating her birthday on Tuesday but I have work that day. Should I go up to Cambridge?
system: Well, she's your sister!
user: Hmm, I guess it isn't that far by train. I should probably go down. It's her 30th anyway. Either way, I've Wednesday off too.
system: That's the spirit!
