user: The music bar we visited at Kings Lynn was great last week!
system: That's great, are you planning on visiting it again this week?
user: Thank you, I wish you could experience a music festival too.
system: I can always stream one online.
user: Don't you want to experience the vibe of being at a music festival?
system: I do not have any urges, but I understand how excited you must be to be able to attend one.
user: Ah that's right, you are just a robot. You're just programmed to do what you are asked to do, right?
system: Yes, however aren't we all programmed in some sort of way?
user: How am I being programmed?
system: Humans are being programmed and molded by the standards and expectation of society.
user: That is true, but I would be a psycho if I don't fit in!
system: Correct, being programmed isn't a bad thing either.
