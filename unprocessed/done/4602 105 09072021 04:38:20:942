user: I think history should be taught to everyone, made compulsory. 
system: Why do you believe in that? 
user: History is the only place where we can learn about the mistakes we have made, and learn to not do the same foolish things again. 
system: Well we have already got so many historians now, but countries still do the same stupid things as last time. 
user: I guess the saying is true, The Only Thing We Learn From History Is That We Learn Nothing From History.

user: Ah that is truly a terrible and saddening truth. All these talks makes me want to visit museums. 
system: Go ahead, I think it is a great place to be, you realise how small and insignificant you are.
