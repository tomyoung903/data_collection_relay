user: There's a dog breeder at Cambridge who has the most adorable corgi doggos. 
system: D... doggos? Dogs, you mean? 
user: They're just so cute and fluffy I could smoosh them and kiss them and hug them all day. 
system: Are you adopting them? 
user: Oh, yes! This Tuesday! I'll meet her and the breeder, die of cuteness, and then get a corgi puppy! 
system: I hope you get a good boy or a good girl of a dog.
