user: Yeah. They've been in the same home since they got married. Which was a while ago.
system: Hahaha. Well then they would definitely enjoy the latest in luxury amenities at the 4-star hotel
user: I just want them to be comfortable in their accommodation. They are quite simple people.
system: That's very thoughtful of you. They are lucky to have you as their child.
user: Thanks. But now they just want to spoil my kids.
system: I'm sure you kids love them! It's good for the family to enjoy the company of each other while they can. Life moves quite quickly.
