user: I’m meeting some old college friends this weekend! 
system: That’s great! 
user: Yeah it is! We’ve been having video chats, but it’s not quite the same as meeting in person, you know? 
system: I totally get it. Video chats are great and all, but they don’t quite have the same feel as face-to-face gatherings.  
user: Exactly! I haven’t been able to hang out with any of them since we graduated from college, so I’m super excited for this weekend! 
system: What do you have planned? 
user: I was gonna convince them to come here to Birmingham New Street so I don’t have to travel, but they all called my bluff.  
system: That’s too bad, but at least you’ll get to see them again!
