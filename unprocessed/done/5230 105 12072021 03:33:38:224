user: The COVID situation here seems to be getting better,  I think I am starting to see hope! 
system: Hang in there! Just a bit more and I think we can pull through together! 
user: Yeah agreed! It has been a super long battle, I thought this was going to be just a quick one but it really became a part of our lives. 
system: How is the infection rate in your area now? Are they opening up as well? 
user: Here in Cambridge I think we have about 30-40 people per day, really getting better, I am not sure about their policy on opening up though. 
system: That is really good! And I am sure most people are vaccinated by now?
