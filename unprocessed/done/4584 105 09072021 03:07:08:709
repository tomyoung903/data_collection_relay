user: I was never a big fan of theatres. 
system: I mean to each their own. I think some are acatually rather enjoyable. 
user: Really? I think that this is an art form that doesn't belong to the modern era. 
system: And why is it no longer relevant in this day and age? 
user: Well everything could be done much better in a movie that's why. Lighting, effects, sound etc. Theatres just feels too primitive. 
system: Have you actually seen any? 
user: I mean no, it was just too underwhelming in my mind so I never had the interest. 
system: I knew it. No one who seen one would've said what you did. The impact it has is simply overwhelming when you actually see it in real life. Just give one a try, trust me!
