user: It's a shame there are no concert halls. Anyway, do you think it's feasible to visit all 4 museums on the same day? I'm worried it's a little too ambitious. 
system: Honestly, I'm not too sure! I guess it might feel a little rushed but there's no harm in trying. You really seem to love museums. 
user: hm ok, i'll take up the challenge then and lol, yea
system: Alright, that's the spirit! Bee-leaf in yourself. Haha. Get it? Fine, it's a little lame. Anyway, hope you have a blast! Goodbye.
