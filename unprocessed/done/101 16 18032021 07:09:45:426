user: I was thinking about ways to take a breather and I was talking about it with my friends.
system: Oh, what did you come up with?
user: Well.. not much. But they did say that a short getaway sometimes helps!
system: What do you mean? I heard that getaways can be just as stressful... But I don't think it can beat studying in Cambridge, right?
user: Yeah definitely. I can relate, sometimes, all you want to do is sit back and relax for a while.
system: Of course. I totally understand. Being caught up with piles of work to do is just infuriating! Can I do anything to lighten your burden?
