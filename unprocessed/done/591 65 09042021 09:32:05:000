user: Good morning, it has been a while since I had to go for a work trip.
system: That is indeed true, what is the plan going to be this time?
user: It is likely that I will be leaving Cambridge next week. From then on, it will be back-to-back conferences and training for me. To be frank, I'm not looking forward to it that much since these trips tend to drain the life out of me.
system: That sounds tiring. Can I do anything to help you out?
