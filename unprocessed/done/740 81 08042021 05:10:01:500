user: Life is so unfair. Just heard my cousin, Vinnie, met with an accident.
system: That's awful. Life can be very hard.
user: Yes it is really hard. This coming at a time when I am financially tight makes it doubly difficult. 
system: I am so sorry to hear that. But remember - Tough times don't last but tough men do.
user: Thanks. That helps a lot. But seeing my cousin undergo a life threatening surgery as early as Tuesday is a huge challenge.
system: Tuesday is an auspicious day and I am sure your cousin's operation will go off well.
