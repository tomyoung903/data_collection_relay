user: Sure, why not? I'm tired of eating in hall. 
system: Oh, why is that? 
user: I have been living and eating hall food since the lockdown, now I want to celebrate. 
system: Any occasion? 
user: Not really. More of the fact that I finally got an email that said I would be prioritised in my hall application. 
system: Ah, I see. Is that good? 
user: Yes definitely. Just last week we got an email saying many of us had been rejected from rooms in the hall. 
system: That's terrible. What would you do? 
user: Well, now that I'm prioritised I don't have to worry so much. But I still am on the lookout for rooms outside. They are almost twice as expensive. I need to save up just in case. 
system: Good thing you are spending less at the restaurant.
