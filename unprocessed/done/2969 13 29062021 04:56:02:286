user: So, I just received a call from my close friend. 
system: What was it about? 
user: She was complaining that we have not met each other in months, and wanted a meet-up. 
system: It's always nice to catch up with friends. Have you two made any plans? 
user: Yes. We're both pretty spontaneous people, so we decided to meet ASAP. I'll go there from nandos city centre. 
system: That sounds great. Since this is an impromptu meeting, I believe you haven't made any travel arrangements yet. Do let me know what you need.
