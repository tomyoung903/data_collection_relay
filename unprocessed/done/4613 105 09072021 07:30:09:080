user: The streets here are really dirty, I expected much more. 
system: Well I think a lot of streets are just not cleaned frequently. 
user: Yeah but people should have the basic courtesy of not littering at least. Cambridge streets are better than this, I hope 
system: You really expect too much from people aye, it is really hard for them to do the right thing sometimes. Why Cambridge specifically though. 
user: I went there once last time and it was really clean. And for this trip I am going to Cambridge again after this stop. 
system: Hahaha no wonder!
