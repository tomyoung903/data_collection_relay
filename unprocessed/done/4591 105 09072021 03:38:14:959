user: My family has been saying that they want to travel. 
system: Why don't you comply with their request then. 
user: Well because I am really busy, and travelling is actually really expensive with a big family you know. 
system: Well yes, but I am sure you can go for it once in a while, don't disappoint them like that. Come on. 
user: Haiz, I know. I have agreed to them, we are going off this wednesday. But it costs so much money! 
system: Money can be earned again but precious time is gone forever if you don't treasure it you know.
