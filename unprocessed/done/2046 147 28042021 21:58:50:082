user: That's a great idea. What is the cost for getting a car for 5 days?
system: Since you're 7 people, might I suggest booking a SUV with 7 seats. Those come by for around $100 per day. The town roads are well maintained and would be a pleasant drive.
user: That's too expensive!!! I guess I'll have to stick with public transport. Is it better to commute using the train system or buses?
system: While trains are economical, they take more time when compared to buses
