user: It's alright. My friends and I are going to this gathering of Arthur fans. 
system: Fascinating. So you guys just meet up and discuss the topic or? 
user: Nah. We all dress up as our favourite characters and do some role play and talk and discuss. Everything is under the same theme. 
system: I get it now. Must be nice to meet like-minded people. 
user: Definitely. It's rare to have such meetings in the first place. We were supposed to have one last year. 
system: It didn't happen? 
user: Yeap. Covid destroyed all our plans. Who would've known? 
system: That's true. 
user: That's it then. I hope the event is as fun as I think it is. 
system: Good luck with your Arthurian trip.
