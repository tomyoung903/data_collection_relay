user: I wonder if there is anything to do during our long trip with my friends. 
system: You can view the beautiful scenery and enjoy the Mother Nature during the train ride! 
user: I sure will. I hope it’s not too boring!  
system: It definitely won’t be. You have a large group of friends that you can talk to! I believe they will hype up the atmosphere! 
user: It is for sure a good bonding session.  
system: You can take a nap during the ride too if all of you feel tired. It’s quite comfortable!
