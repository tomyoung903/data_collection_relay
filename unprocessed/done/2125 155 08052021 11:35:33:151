user: Yes actually. If we finish dining earlier, should we call it a night or should we walk around the area?
system: Don't waste the night away, there are many things to do in the centre of town!
user: Could you recommend a few then?
system: There's a karaoke lounge right across Kohinoor, or you could look out for the jazz bar down the street where they have live bands on Wednesdays!
user: Sounds like a blast, thanks!
system: No worries, hope you have fun!
