user: Thanks. What activities should I do at the party?  
system: That depends. Do all of them know each other? 
user: No, some are friends of friends. 
system: Perhaps you should try some icebreaker games, to make the vibe less awkward! A popular game I found online is 2 Truths 1 Lie. 
user: That's true. I'm afraid the party will turn out to be a failure. 
system: Don't fret it. The more you're worried about it, the less fun it will be! Just loosen up and relax, and it'll all be fine! 
user: Thanks for the assurance! 
system: No problem, hope all goes well.
