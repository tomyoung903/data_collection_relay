user: It's alright. I'm finally teaching my girlfriend how to swim. 
system: Oh, I see. She doesn't know? 
user: Yeap. We both made a pact to teach a skill to each other once we graduate. 
system: That's nice. Did she teach you any skills yet? 
user: Yeah. I finally learnt how to ride a bicycle. 
system: Oh hahaha. How old are you? 
user: Approaching 25. I know, I know, a 25-year-old who doesn't know how to cycle. It's quite embarrassing. 
system: Not necessarily. The fact that you were still willing to learn and face the embarrassment says a lot about you. 
user: Good things I hope. 
system: Yes absolutely. It's never too late to learn. Enjoy your visit to the pool.
