user: Dude, my stomach needs to be compensated, but its getting to end of this month. So...you know, i need some cheaper and nicer choices :( 
system: Un-huh, I bet the price of Catalan styled food is just like clouds of the sky. Its beautiful but untouchable. So try Spanish!
user: Spanish? I have been there once. The price level in Spain is so high! Are you cheating me by telling some fake restaurant?
system: No, actually food there is not very expensive. I dont know if u like it. Im loven the authentic flavour over there. Just have a try lah.
