user: That's all! Actually, I am writing a novel but lacking ideas. 
system: Wow, that's cool. Changing environments might be a good option. 
user: Not cool at all. I just hope that my first draft can pass. If not I am going to stay on the street. 
system: All the best to you and be creative in your writing! Maybe during your stays in these days you can gain some new perspective? 
user: Thank you for your kind suggestion and I think I should keep on writing now. 
system: You can do it! Try your best and remember to enjoy this as a journey!
