user: I am planning this surprise trip for my wife. I am worried she will not like it. 
system: I am sure she will like this pleasant surprise. Is this a trip in a long while? 
user: Yes, it is. Her birthday is around the corner too.  
system: That's lovely. You can check with the hotel if they can help to prepare a birthday surprise. A cake would be great too. 
user: That's a great idea. I should get started. 
system: May the surprise be a success!
