user: An acquaintance told me he experienced some supernatural activity when he was touring the center of town. 
system: What? Are you going ghost hunting ? 
user: That's right! He said he saw something at the college. 
system: That's very concerning. What if the ghosts follow you back to the hotel? 
user: Don't scare me like that! I actually don't believe in ghosts but now I'm scared. 
system: Haha I don't believe in supernatural activity either but good luck with your hunt!
