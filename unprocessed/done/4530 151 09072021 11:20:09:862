user: It's alright. I'm taking my nephew and nieces for a great outing with their favourite uncle.  
system: And you are their favourite uncle? 
user: I'm their only direct uncle. I better be the favourite. 
system: Hahaha. Alright, you are their favourite. 
user: That's more like it.  
system: So why the sudden outing? 
user: Their parents are busy at work and with their holidays starting, they are also starting to be a nuisance at home. 
system: Ah, I see. So their parents contracted you to reduce their energy levels by the time they get back.  
user: As the younger, cooler uncle, the kids have always liked me. And don't call it contract. I like spending time with them. They are like my own kids to me.  
system: I'm sure the House will be entertaining.
