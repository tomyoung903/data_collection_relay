user: Hi, it's been such a hassle organising this trip. It seems like there's more and more to do everyday.
system: Hello, that does not sound good. What's causing you problems now?
user: Well, aside from all the administrative issues that I have to handle for everyone I will be meeting. I also need to find tickets for Wednesday. There are just so many options to choose from.
system: That is true, the system is quite complex. But do not worry! I can assist you, is there anything in particular you would like to know? Perhaps about the pricing?
