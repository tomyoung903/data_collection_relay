user: I just got back my university exchange result and I'm so pumped to be spending my summer term in Cambridge! 
system: You seem to be really looking forward to spending time there! 
user: Visiting Cambridge and seeing the town has always been a childhood dream of mine! I can't believe this is all coming true for me! 
system: You deserved it! You've been working hard for it anyway. 
user: I agree! These past few months have been crazy busy for me! It was so difficult to plan for this! 
system: Lucky you! Everything came through! 
user: Oh no, you just reminded me - I have to plan for moving there too! 
system: Most definitely, there's the moving and also accomodation to look for! Have you got a date in mind? 
user: I'm planning to leave on saturday so I can get there and unpack ahead of time. 
system: That sounds like a brilliant idea.
