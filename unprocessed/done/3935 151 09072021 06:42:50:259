user: That's great. I'm finally meeting my two best friends after 5 years. 
system: Awesome. What took you guys so long? 
user: Oh boy. So many reasons. Working conflicts, family business and etc. We always wanted to hang out once every year after we graduated.  
system: So for the past 5 years, you guys never hung out? 
user: Virtually a few times. Other times, well, what I said before. 
system: You all must be very excited to meet each other then. 
user: Yeap. Can't wait to catch up with them. They were like family to me. 
system: That's really sweet. Are they all coming from around here? 
user: Nope. Both of them are flying in from different countries. I want to be a gracious host and welcome them over here.  
system: I think you are doing a good job. I'm sure they'll like the expensive food and the great guesthouse.
