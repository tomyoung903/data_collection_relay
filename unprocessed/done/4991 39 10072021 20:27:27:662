user: I feel very stressed these days, for the workload from my boss is too heavy. 
system: Sorry to hear that, I think you should find some time and pick up you hobbies to have a rest. 
user: I think you are right. I love watching movies but I do not know about the cinemas since I just moved here. Maybe I will need your help some day. 
system: Sure, I will be glad to help and hope you can have a nice week.
