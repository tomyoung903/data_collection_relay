user: John and I just saw the starry night at the museum of modern art.
system: That painting is a work of art.
user: It is! I have never been fond of art, but this museum might have changed my mind.
system: Sounds like it was a really good experience.
user: Indeed, we spent hours walking around looking at paintings. However, there was one problem we faced.
system: What was the issue?
user: All that time spent appreciating art left us feeling really hungry. However, there were no available food options around in the museum.
system: At least you know what to look for the next time.
