user: My mother staying in Ely is very sick and I'm worried about her. However, I'm staying in Cambridge...
system: I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been hard on you.
user: Thank you for your concern, she's undergoing treatment now and I'm afraid I would have to take a break from work to care for her.
system: That's very thoughtful of you! Do you plan to bring her somewhere too?
user: I plan to bring her to all the places she wished to visit and spend more time with her.
system: You are a very filial daughter! Please send my best regards and hope she gets well soon!
