user: Hey, actually I forgot, but do you feel that I should go for a 5 stars instead of 3 stars? 
system: I am sorry, I am unable to make such decisions for you, but 3 stars would be cheaper. 
user: Hmm, maybe I should stick to my 3 stars then. 
system: Do not worry, at least it is cheap. 
user: That is true, maybe it is worth my price. 
system: Yes, worry less and have more fun!
