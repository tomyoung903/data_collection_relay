user: It's okay. My grandparents are coming over to visit me.  
system: That's nice. They are not staying at your place? 
user: Nope. I'm living with many roommates so my parents suggested putting them in a hotel. 
system: Ah alright, that's nice. 
user: Yeah. The best part is I get to stay with them. So for a few days, I can enjoy the hotel lifestyle. 
system: Must be nice to get away from your room. 
user: It is. The beds are so comfortable. And then there is complimentary breakfast. It's great 
system: Such a highly rated room should be great.
