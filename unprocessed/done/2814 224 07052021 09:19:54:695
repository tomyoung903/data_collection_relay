user: Do you think kids will like the food at the restaurant? They can be very picky eaters. It's so hard to find food for them.
system: The restaurant claims to have an 'awesome menu' so I'm sure there will be something the kids will love. Especially since anything with cheese tends to be popular with kids. 
user: oh yes, that's true! My kids have an obsession with cheese. I guess you're right.
system: Have a grate meal! Hope that pun wasn't too... cheesy.
