user: I have been stressed out at work recently.
system: Oh that sounds troubling, I am sorry you are going through this. What happened?
user: There has just been too many projects with short deadlines.
system: That is unfortunate. I like taking long walks on the beach to unwind.
user: That is a good way to unwind. I prefer spending time in nature like a park.
system: Hmm, that sounds like a good idea. Have you considered doing so?
