user: I just got a new job as a Software Engineer!
system: That's great! I heard it pays well.
user: It does, although the commute to the new office is long.
system: Oh that sounds like a downside.

system: That will definitely cut down the commute time for you.
user: Yeah, and I heard bishops stortford is a pretty nice place to live in.
system: It sure is!
