user: My boyfriend likes to draw 
system: Is he a professional?  
user: He is not, but I have to admit his art pieces are quite nice! 
system: He must have a large collection of art pieces then! 
user: Maybe. He is running out of ideas from what I am heard. 
system: You can bring him the gallery to give him some inspiration for his next drawing!  
user: That’s a great idea. I am not sure if he’s free. 
system: You can call him and ask if he wants to go. I am sure he will be willing to go with you!
