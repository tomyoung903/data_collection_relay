user: Oh boy am I excited to spend time with my best friend, Katie!
system: What would the two of you be doing?
user: Probably watch a movie and gossip about boys... hehe! There isn't much to do on a college campus at night anyway.
system: Oh, are you having a sleepover?
user: Yes we will be having a sleepover! We did not have the chance to spend much time together recently. We will be having the sleepover at churchill college where Katie is studying!
