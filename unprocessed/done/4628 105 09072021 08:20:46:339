user: Do you happen to have an artist you like? 
system: Not in particular, I do know some of them but I don't have a favourite. 
user: Ah you should really get one, mine is mikovsky for his strokes and the ideas he wants to express. 
system: I was really never that into arts so I can't really understand all these things you say. 
user: I guess it comes with time and seeing enough artworks. Mikovsky is having an exhibition at the Ruskin Gallery so I am really looking forward to that. 
system: I don't know how to appreciate but I am sure you do, hope you will have a great time!
