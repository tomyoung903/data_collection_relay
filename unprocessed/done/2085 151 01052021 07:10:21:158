user: Traffic today was a nightmare.
system: Oh, what happened? 

user: Don't know. All I saw was an overturned car by the side of the road with lot's of police around it
system: Oh, dear seems like a bad accident. Hope the people involved are okay.
user: Yeah. I remember the time when someone bumped into my car from the back and then just ran away. I couldn't even put in a complaint because I had no idea where to go for a complaint.
system: Don't worry. I can help you with that. Ask me anything
