user: The art scene around these parts is despicable. I visited the worst exhibition here in Broxbourne this weekend. 
system: Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? 
user: I met a bunch of pretentious posers. This one guy tried to make some kind of meta-commentary on society during the pandemic. It's been done before, and better. 
system: Ah. Did you find anything interesting there? 
user: Not at all. And this same guy spilled coffee all over my expensive shirt. 
system: oh, I'm sorry! I hope you weren't hurt.
