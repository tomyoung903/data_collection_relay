user: Thank you! It's my friend's birthday and we plan to hold an extravagant lunch.  
system: expensive 
user: I hope so. He hasn't had much asian food. He likes Australian food a lot though. 
system: It's good to try new things. I think his mood will be lifted when you all visit the garden. 
user: You might be right. He has green fingers so he will enjoy the plants. 
system: Don't worry too much! He will definitely enjoy a lunch that you and your friends took time to organize.
