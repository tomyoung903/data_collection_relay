user: I can't believe they are holding the annual computer conference in Leicester this year. 
system: Why is it hard to believe? 
user: Traditionally it has always been in the US, so I was really caught off guard. 
system: Maybe they just wanted something refreshing after so long. 
user: Haha perhaps! Well at least it is more convenient for me now. Leicester is really near. 
system: Yeah you should wish they hold it there every year!
