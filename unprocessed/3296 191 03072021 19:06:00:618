user: Alright. Now can you find me some friends? Haha I'm just kidding.  
system: Don't be so hard on yourself, everyone finds friends eventually.

system: Striking up a conversation in a pool might be rare, but you could try that when you go.  
user: That sounds like an idea for another time. I will just take my alone time for now. 
system: Alright, I wish you all the best.
