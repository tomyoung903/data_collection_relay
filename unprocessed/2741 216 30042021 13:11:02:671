user: Hey, actually do you think it will be safe for my friends and I to go for a boat ride? 
system: Yes, there are life jackets given so you do not have to worry too much.
user: I am worried because 2 of my friends do not know how to swim.
system: You can pair up since there is 6 of you. I am sure it will be fine.
user: Okay, I hope this trip will be fun. 
system: I am sure it will and hope you have a good time with your friends.
