user: Hey, guess what! 
system: You sound excited! Did something good happen? 
user: Yes, a big client of mine is interested in signing a 3-year contract with me. 
system: That sounds amazing. I'm so glad for you. 
user: I have to meet him once to sign the contract. Once that's done, I'll have a steady stream of commissions. We've agreed to meet at da vinci pizzeria.  
system: It's always great to hear good news, I'm sure the contract will provide you with a larger network and more exposure as well.
