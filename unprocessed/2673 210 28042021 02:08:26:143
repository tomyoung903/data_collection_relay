user: I would like to get a train departing from Brackley at about 3pm to London
system: Okay. There is one depart at 3.05pm. I will help you to book that. How many seats do you need?
user: 2 seats is enough for me.
system: The booking is done. Your reference number is 3CZFPPV. Anything else?
user: I would like to have a two days one night vacation in London. Can you recommend me some attractions?
system: You can go for Rye. There are antique shops and higgledy-piggledy cobbled lanes which make you feels like a little piece of the Cotswolds on the coast.
