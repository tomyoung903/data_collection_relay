user: my family love noodles, this sounds like a good option! are the food spicy though? my younger siblings can't take spicy food. 
system: Yippee Noodle Bar has quite some options, I think your siblings can find one that suits them. 
user: that's relieving to hear. oh, i also wanted to ask about parking at Yippee Noodle Bar. is it free? 
system: yes. Are you taking your family shopping in town after lunch? 
user: indeed. it has been quite long since we've been out on a shopping trip, I wanted to get my parents some presents. 
system: that's really sweet of you. I'm sure your parents are very proud of you.
