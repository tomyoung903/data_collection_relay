user: This is my first time travelling on a train in years. Kind of nervous leading such a huge group.
system: I'm certain you'll manage. Plus, train rides can be pretty enjoyable with all the scenery.
user: That's true. I hope my kids behave themselves on the train.
system: Kids will be kids. Maybe you can find something to keep them distracted.
user: Yeah I will probably have to get to that too. Thanks for the reminder.
system: No worries. I hope you have a safe journey!
