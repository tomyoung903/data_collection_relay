user: Get me 4? I'm travelling with my wife and kids to visit my sister. 
system: Oh, that's nice. Just a regular social call? 
user: You could say that. She just wanted to have a get together after we moved home.  
system: So like a housewarming party? 
user: Well, it would make sense if it was done at our home since we were the ones who moved. I guess she just wants to have the family together. 
system: Not a housewarming party then, just a family gathering. Sounds good. 
user: Haha yeah. I just wish it was easy to get there. Moving home has made me lose track of how to get from point A to B. I hope I don't get lost at the station. 
system: Don't worry. I'm sure you'll catch your train.
