user: How fast is the wifi at the hotel? I will need to upload videos onto Youtube as I am a Content Creator.
system: While streaming may be fine, uploading may take a few moments as the upload speeds are not fantastic
user: It's okay, i can wait as long as it works.
system: It should work out fine as long as network traffic isn't too congested and your videos aren't too long!
