user: Alright. My Jamaican buddies finally came over to visit after many years. 
system: That's great. How do you know them? 
user: A few years ago I went over to Jamaica for a research project. 
system: Nice. What was your research project about? 
user: On global warming. We were wondering what are the effects on island nations. Those 2 were my research partners. We had a lot of fun together. 
system: Sounds great. How long has it been since you met them? 
user: Almost 5 years now. I told them if they ever come over, they are welcome to stay at my place. I just want to be a gracious host and give them the best time here. 
system: I'm sure they'll enjoy Scudamores.
