user: My best friend's birthday is coming and I am looking for a gift to get but I am not sure of what to get for him. 
system: The restaurant that you are dining in has a wine shop where you could get some good quality or prestigious wine for your friend! 
user: That's a very good recommendation. It is also convenient for me as well. I really hopes he like it. 
system: I am sure it will. Wine is usually enjoyed in company and it is definitely a good gift to celebrate a long-lasting friendship! 
user: I hope I can afford the prices of the wine. I heard that good wines are quite expensive! 
system: It won't be an issue! There are wines for all budget and it is really the thought that counts.
