user: Hello there, I am from Singapore and I will be visiting Cambridge for a week in two months
system: Hi, is there anything you would like to know more about our city?
user: Yes actually. I would be interested in knowing about the colleges that are in the city. I have heard great things about them
system: Well, there are many that we have here. All of them are renowned schools and they each have their own feel. You should visit them if you have the opportunity to.
user: I do not have a lot of time in Cambridge unfortunately. I will only be there for a week and there are other places that I already have on my itinerary.
system: In that case, are there any that you would like to visit in particular? We have a lot to visit and you would not have enough time to visit them all.
