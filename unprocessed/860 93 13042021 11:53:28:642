user: Coming Monday is a public holiday! This means the weekend is going to be a long weekend!
system: Great to know! People normally spent long weekends relaxing from school or work.
user: Yes, my friends and I had been thinking about visiting a museum for quite some time. Maybe we should do it this Sunday!
system: Museums are typically packed on Sundays, you might need to change your plans if it's overcrowded.
user: It's fine, we are leaving on Sunday morning and be back after dinner on Monday, should have time for any changes.
system: That should be more than enough time to handle any change of plans.
