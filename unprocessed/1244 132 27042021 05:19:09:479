user: I'm going on a date with my wife. She doesn't like fancy things, but since it's our anniversary I want to surprise her. 
system: Oh congratulations! Well, there are many things you could do.
user: Yeah I was thinking of getting her some flowers maybe? And a nice dinner just us without the kids, and a movie after that.
system: Well that sounds like a splendid idea. I'm sure she'd enjoy herself. How many kids do you have?
user: We have three boys...and they're a handful. My wife has been quite stressed taking care of our rowdy boys recently.
system: Well, I'm sure this would be a welcome break for her then.
