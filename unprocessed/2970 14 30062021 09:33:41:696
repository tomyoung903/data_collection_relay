user: I can't believe I get to visit my dream school next Monday!  
system: I'm so happy for you. Where is it? 
user: Of course it can only be magdalene college, where else?  
system: That's a great one. How long have you been hoping to go there? 
user: I don't know. For as long as I can remember.  
system: The campus is beautiful and has a rich history. You'll be close to nature there, too, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.  
user: You guessed right! I've only heard good things about the park. Maybe I'll be able to spot some deer there.  
system: I hope you do. What will you need to realise your dream on Monday?
