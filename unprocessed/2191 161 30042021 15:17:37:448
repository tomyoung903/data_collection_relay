user: After a long week, I just want to be able to treat myself...
system: I get you. I think steak at the Chop House would be a good treat for yourself, plus I heard their wine selection is superb
user: I'm not about to engage in a midday drinking session.
system: I'm sorry. Sure there are other ways to relax after a hectic week.
user: Yeah I hope the steak is good. Thanks for the suggestion.
system: You are most welcome! I hope things go well for you this week, and all the best!
