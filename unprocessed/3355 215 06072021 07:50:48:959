user: my family love noodles, this sounds like a good option! are the food spicy though? my younger siblings can't take spicy food. 
system: I think your siblings can find one that suits their tastes with the wide variety there. 
user: oh, that's relieving to hear. just to confirm again, it is free to leave my car there at the restaurant right? 
system: yes, it is. Are you taking your family shopping in town after lunch? 
user: indeed. it has been quite long since we've been out on a shopping trip, I wanted to get my parents some presents. 
system: that's really sweet of you. I'm sure your parents are very proud of you.
