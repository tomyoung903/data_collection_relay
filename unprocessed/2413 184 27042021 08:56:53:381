user: Yes, I was wondering if taking the flight was a better idea as it is faster. 
system: Actually, that might be a better option, the train takes longer when compared to flight and if you go early you can enjoy the sightseeing aswell.
user: The work is not a main priority and it can wait I’m just hesitant to go on a plane as I am scared
system: You don’t need to be. Nowadays flights are becoming very reliable and more technologically advanced! They can take you from one place to another very safely.
user: True, but ever since my childhood I have never been good with heights, they scare me 
system: Fear of heights is a very common thing. You should try to come out of it slowly, perhaps starting with this flight travel might be a good idea.
