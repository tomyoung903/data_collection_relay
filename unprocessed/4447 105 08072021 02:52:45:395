user: Hey what is your favourite mode of transportation? 
system: Probably a plane? It is fast, comfortable and you have this quiet little trip where literally no one can disturb you. 
user: Okay those are fair points but with my fear of heights I have always hated planes. 
system: What is your favourite then? 
user: I actually like boat trip a lot! They are slow, you feel much safer being on something more solid than flying in air. Furthermore the breeze while you are on water is just different from land! 
system: I see! Well its truly a pity you don't enjoy aeroplane rides, they would be so good if you don't have the phobia.
