user: Yeah, I just witnessed a hit and run. 
system: Oh no, do you require information for the ambulance as well?
user: No I have it already. It does not seem to be too serious. I managed to get the license plate of the car. Looks like a drunk driver.
system: One should never drive a car while drunk, I hope the police are able to track him down.
