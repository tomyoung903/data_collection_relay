user: Yes, I am going alone. Why do you ask?
system: You should call someone close to you to come and keep you company in the hospital.
user: I think I’m going to call my roommate. I think he’s still in his room.

user: Yeah, it’s really nice to have someone close to you.
system: Do get to the hospital asap.
