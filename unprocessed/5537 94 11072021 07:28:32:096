user: Today's the last day of the exchange program of the foreign students that I am responsible for. 
system: Did they had fun while staying here ? 
user: They did ! They are very happy during their stay. But I got feedback that some of them are tired of the food here. 
system: That's unfortunate. What do they prefer then ? 
user: The students are from the mediterranean, which I heard have great food. I guess they are missing the food from their hometown. 
system: I've heard that Mediterranean cuisine is exquisite too. 
user: Since it's the last day the exchange program, and there's some budget left, I should bring the students out for some mediterranean cuisine. 
system: I am sure your students will be grateful to you for doing so.
