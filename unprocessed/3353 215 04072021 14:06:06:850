user: Since this is a holiday I planned for my older relatives and grandparents, is the Castle Galleries elderly-friendly? 
system: Castle Galleries is definitely elderly-friendly. they have structures for the wheelchair-bound and their staff are all very patient. 
user: that is reassuring! hopefully my family have a good time there and I don't burn a hole in my wallet. 
system: I think they would. You don't need to worry about the finances, Autumn House and Castle Galleries are all affordable options.
