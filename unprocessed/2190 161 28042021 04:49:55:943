user: Actually, what's your take on food ideas for a first date?
system: I wouldn't know, because I don't have tastebuds to begin with. Eating is unfamiliar to me. Turkish, Indian, no difference.
user: Okay that's true. Forget that I asked.
system: I'm kidding. But reviews for Anatolia is decent, so you can tell me how it went after your visit.
user: Sure. Wish me luck. I'm hoping she likes Turkish.
system: All the best!
