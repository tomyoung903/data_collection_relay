user: Hello is this the Cambridge TownInfo centre? 
system: Yes, it's certainly is! How may I be of assistance today?
user: I am celebrating my niece's birthday this coming weekend. I want to see if there is anywhere I can spend the morning before I head over in the afternoon.
system: Ah, sounds like it is going to be an extremely pleasant week for you! For me to recommend something I will need to know some of your interests.
user: Well, I love history and art, so perhaps somewhere with a mix of both will be good?
system: I suggest the Museums in Cambridge. There are plenty around town and many of them hold interesting collections too! Do you want to narrow down your locality so I can provide a more tailored recommendation ?
