user: One of my friends can't really take spicy food, do you think he'll be ok? 
system: Even though Thai food is renowned for its spicy to very spicy tastes, it is a fallacy to think that all Thai food is spicy. 
user: Ah, that's a relief to hear. 
system: You could always approach the restaurant's staff and ask them if the food is spicy. You could even ask them to remove the spice. 
user: Alright, I'll make sure to do that. 
system: It's nice that you're looking out for your friend!
