user: My brother is so in love with football. He literally talks about it every single day. 
system: How about you? 
user: I watch the leagues with him sometimes but I don't know much about it. Anyway, I want to get a football merchandise for my brother. I know a shop at London Liverpool Street sells them. 
system: That is right. Would you be going there?
