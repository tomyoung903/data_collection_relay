user: I thought I could finally get some rest this Saturday but guess I was wrong. 
system: What do you mean? Did your plan for rest get disturbed. 
user: Yes. I was going to take a break but I got a last minute urgent appointment from a client now I have to rush over. 
system: Sounds terrible. Hey you should really treat yourself after the event then at least to partly make up for it.
