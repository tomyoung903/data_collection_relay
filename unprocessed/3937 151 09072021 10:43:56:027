user: Not for now. My friends and I want to catch a glimpse of the next Mission Impossible movie. 
system: Oh. Are they shooting scenes nearby? 
user: According to my sources. 
system: Are these sources trustworthy? 
user: Absolutely. They have been revealing prior movie locations for the past 2 years with almost 90% accuracy. 
system: Damn. That is pretty accurate. Why do you want to catch the filming anyway? 
user: To catch my favourite star, Tom Cruise, of course. I have been a big fan of him since I saw him in Top Gun. 
system: I see. Do you want to take a picture with him? Get an autograph perhaps? 
user: Yeah definitely. But I heard he now produces his own movies. One of my friends on the inside said he could get me some private time with Mr Cruise. 
system: Oh, dear. Sounds very sketchy. 
user: I trust him. Although I have to grease some wheels before I get successful. 
system: Good thing you have cheaper accomodations.
