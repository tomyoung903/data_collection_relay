user: Have you heard of Deepavali? 
system: Yes, I have. Isn't that the festival celebrated in India? 
user: Yes, it is. I'm bringing my girlfriend to try out some Indian food on this special day. 
system: Oh, it's like a small way to celebrate the festival of lights. 
user: I guess it is. It's a really good chance to try some new food too. The only Indian food I know is curry. 
system: That's a start. Curry is already quite popular in Britain. You should explore Indian food more.
