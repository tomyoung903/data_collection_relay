user: Sure thing. I just met my doctor today. 
system: Are you alright? 
user: Yeah. Just a regular check-up to make sure my body was running fine. 
system: Okay. What did the doctor say? 
user: He said my BMI and cholesterol levels have increased. 
system: Damn. Did he give you any medication? 
user: No, my condition isn't that bad. I just need to exercise more that's all. 
system: Ah, I see. That's fine then. Exercise is good for the body. 
user: Yeap. This is why I've decided to walk as much as possible, starting with walking to dinner this evening. I hope I don't get lost. 
system: Don't worry. You can always call Nirala to check.
