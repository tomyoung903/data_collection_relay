user: What should I wear?
system: For a brunch on a Tuesday, I think something bright and cheerful would be nice. 
user: Hmm, something yellow?
system: Definitely, yellow would be my preferred colour, but of course, comfort always comes first. Are you going out on a date with your significant other?
user: Well, I do wish he was my significant other, but sadly, no. We are still in the talking stage.
system: Oh, the talking stage. How is it? Is it going great?
user: It's not too bad, except for the fact that he has commitment issues. 
system: Oh no, not the dreaded commitment issues. To be booking a meal with him, I'm assuming you must really like him?
user: Yes, kind of. Is it weird if the girl is the one planning the date?
system: No, not at all. It's the 21st century. Women can take charge if they want to, there's nothing weird about that. It's all about equality nowadays. 
user: Glad to hear that. Thanks for talking to me. 
system: You're welcome. Always feel free to talk to me. I am here for you.
