user: Finding good deal for a stay is difficult nowadays. Why can't things be cheaper?
system: Well don't tell me you regret that you were fine with the high price range. A sudden change of heart?
user: No.. I'm only willing to spend this much because my family hasn't been on a vacation for so long and I want them to have a good time.
system: I'm sure your family would appreciate it. Maybe you could find some activities to do together as a family during your stay.
user: Yeah that's a good idea. Thanks for the suggestion!
system: Great! Hope you guys enjoy yourselves.
