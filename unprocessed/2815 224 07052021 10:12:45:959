user: err wait, can I do a walk-in booking? I almost forgot, lol. Everyone's so pumped so I wanna make sure the trip is smooth sailing even tho the trip is so impromptu. We haven't even started packing, everything's so last minute!
system: Sorry but strictly no walk-ins. Not to worry, I've got you covered! Need to book the room? Easy-peasy. Just send me the info and you're good to go. 
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I'll think about it. I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
