user: how are the reviews of the Lovell Lodge like? I'm wondering if it is worth the price. 
system: Lovell Lodge is quite worth for the amount you're paying for according to the reviews online. The room is larger than other hotels for the same price and has fairly good service. 
user: Sounds good. can you make a reservation for 2 on wednesday and thursday? my girlfriend and I are celebrating our anniversary. 
system: reservation is made. the reference number is 237429DW. is the lovell lodge near somewhere you guys will be spending the day time at? 
user: yes, we were intending to have a picnic at the beach nearby. 
system: that's romantic. happy anniversary!
