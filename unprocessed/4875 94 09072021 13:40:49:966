user: My boss is killing me with all the work she's giving me ! 
system: Sounds like you have a difficult boss. 
user: Totally. She's the type to call me up for overtime over the weekends on short notice too. 
system: That's rough. My condolences to you. 
user: I should disappear from town on Saturday. She can't call me back when I'm not available ! 
system: That's a smart move ! Hopefully it works out for you.
