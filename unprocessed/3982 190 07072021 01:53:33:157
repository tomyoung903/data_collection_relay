user: My child got first place in his class. I plan to reward him by going on this trip. 
system: You can definitely treat him to a scrumptious and mouth-watering meal at the restaurant to reward him for his hard work! 
user: We always do that when he score well for his test.  
system: That will serve as a good motivation for him to continue working harder to achieve academic excellence!
