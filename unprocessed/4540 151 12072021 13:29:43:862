user: Alright. My girlfriend and I are going on a staycation together. 
system: Oh, what is a staycation? 
user: Just a vacation together. 
system: Oh hahaha. Nothing different then. 
user: Nah. Probably less travelling in a staycation rather than a vacation. 
system: I see. Why are you going on this outing? 
user: We both just graduated from university. We are planning to spend some time together before we get back to work. 
system: Ah, I see. So it's not like a gap year then? 
user: Haha nope. We can barely afford this staycation. A gap year is well out of our range. We just want to enjoy the stay. 
system: Enjoy the chinese cuisine.
