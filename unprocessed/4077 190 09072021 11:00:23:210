user: My kids loves to draw! They drew a family portrait of us recently!  
system: That's very sweet and wonderful. Did you draw with them too!  
user: I can't find time to do it! I have been very busy at work these few weeks!  
system: I am sure you can make use of the free time at the hotel room to engage them in a family bonding session where everyone can start drawing together!  
user: My artistic skill isn't that great!  
system: You don't have to be great at it! I am sure your kids will love it if you are able to join in!
