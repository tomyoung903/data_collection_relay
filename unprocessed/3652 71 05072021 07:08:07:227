user: I wonder if there are any good souvenirs to buy from duty-free at the airport? 
system: I wonder too. Perhaps you might want to go to the airport earlier so that you can look around? 
user: Oh, I see. On the same subject of souvenirs, I wonder if I can find some shops in Cambridge for trinkets to bring home? 
system: Why not? You might find more if you try more places.
