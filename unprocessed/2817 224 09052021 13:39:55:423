user: I can't believe I'm telling a system this but.. here goes. I'm worried the restoration will go wrong. 
system: Nah, all's good! It'll just be between us anyway. 
user: Do you think the art piece will be in good hands at Williams Art and Antiques? Man, this is SO embarrassing. 
system: They've got 25 years of experience, I'm sure they've got high standards for restoration. I mean they've lasted for so long. Have some faith, it'll be ok! 
user: true...
system: I wish you the best of luck. I'm sure the restoration will turn out great!
