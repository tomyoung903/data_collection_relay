user: But I am worried, Stansted Airport is quite a busy spot! 
system: No worries, I can find something to cater to your needs. Anything that you would like me to consider?
user: Nothing special, it should leave after noon, as I won't be free before that.

user: No, I never leave my team behind. Its my strength.
system: I agree, may I know the number?
