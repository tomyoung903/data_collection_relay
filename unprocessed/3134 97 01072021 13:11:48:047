user: I'm feeling really down these days. 
system: Oh no, are you feeling alright? 
user: Not really...my mother is really sick but I'm currently living in Broxbourne. I would like to visit her as soon as possible. 
system: Stay strong! I know how that feels when it's our loved ones. 
user: Thank you. I'm planning to bring her for a good meal when I'm finally able to take a break from work. 
system: I'm sure she would love it. Are you taking a train there?
