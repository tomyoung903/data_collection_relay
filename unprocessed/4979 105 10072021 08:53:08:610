user: Dude this fried rice here is so good! 
system: Fried rice is always good what do you even mean. 
user: Okay that is where you are wrong, I thought so once but man was I wrong, the rice could be too hard or too sticky, the flavour could be too strong or too weak. 
system: Well then maybe tell me what it is so that I could go there sometimes. 
user: I am at the golden wok, really good stuff you should try it sometimes. 
system: Sure! I will certainly take note, definitely tell me about bad fried rice restaurants as well!
