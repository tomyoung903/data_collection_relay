user: I'm so glad I decided to learn cooking this summer! It has been so fulfilling! 
system: Sounds like you've been keeping busy. What do you enjoy about cooking? 
user: I found out that cooking is about understanding the stories and context behind food on top of just knowing how to cook something! Anyone can cook, but not everyone can blend the stories and the food together! 
system: It sounds like you've learnt a lot about cooking! Is there any specific cuisine that you're looking into now? 
user: Definitely! I've my eyes set on learning Australian cooking! I'm not sure what exactly qualifies though, so I'll probably need some form of reference. 
system: Is there anyone you know that may have some idea? 
user: Not personally, I've no Australian friends! 
system: Oh dear, it may be a bit difficult then!
