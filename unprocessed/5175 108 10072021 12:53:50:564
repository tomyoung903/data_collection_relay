user: I wonder if it will rain this week. 
system: Why not check the weather forecast? 
user: The forecast only exists to spite me. It is never correct when I depend on it. 
system: It sounds as if you have had some bad experiences. 
user: It says it will be clear for the week, but since I need to travel to cambridge it will probably rain to ruin my trip. 
system: I hope that will not happen.
