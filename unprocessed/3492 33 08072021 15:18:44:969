user: My last exam will be on Friday. I'm so nervous! 
system: Don't be nervous! Just make sure you are prepared for it and go in with a calm mind. 
user: Thank you! I can't wait for it to end because I will be visiting my cousins right after my last exam! And my cousin stays a few cities away so I will have to think of a mode of transport. 
system: Sounds good! Have you thought of how you will be going?
