user: I never knew! Thanks for the information
system: Perhaps you could bring along a friend or go on a guided group tour to learn more together.
user: Hmm, I'll consider taking a guided tour. Half of the time when I look at the exhibits I have no clue what is going on
system: I'm sure having a guide will benefit both you and the museum mutually, you'll be able to learn more while helping to sustain their exhibits
