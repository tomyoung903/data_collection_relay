user: Tonight I've got a big party at Meghna. 
system: A big party? Try not to get too carried away with the alcohol. 
user: No, it's not that kind of party. It's more like a ball. I'm networking with others for my company. 
system: I see, I see. Did you prepare for it? 
user: Of course. I already have my outfit ironed and ready to go. I just have to make some final preparations for the promotional documents we will be giving out. 
system: Then I'll leave you to it.
