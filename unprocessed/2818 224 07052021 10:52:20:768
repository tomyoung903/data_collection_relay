user: just kidding, fooled you didn't I? Anyway, I'm going there for a date. Do you think she will be impressed by the restaurant? I wanna leave a good impression, I really like her.
system: I'm sure she will! It's so fancy. Remember to give her the right dress code, you wouldn't want her to be underdressed and feel out of place. Enjoy your fancy-schmancy date and best of luck with her! You've got this.
user: alright, thanks mr system! really appreciate it. i hope all goes well too, she's just so amazing. 
system: I'm rooting for you! Go get her. Also, if you know any other systems that might be interested in dating, let me know. ;-) Kidding. Goodbye!
