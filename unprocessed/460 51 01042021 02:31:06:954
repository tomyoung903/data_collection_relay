user: Why do job interviews during a meal exist?
system: Are you asking specifically about why they exist during a meal, or why job interviews exist at all?
user: The former.
system: Maybe it's because it saves time and more efficient.
user: But it's so strange! I'm afraid of being asked a question when having my mouth full.
system: Do your best to take small bites.
user: Now that I think about it, I should actually have a proper meal before the dinner interview later at eraina. I probably won't be able to eat properly during the interview.
system: Sounds like a good plan, I hope the interview goes well for you!
