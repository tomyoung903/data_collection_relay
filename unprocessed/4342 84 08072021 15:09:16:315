user: Today I'm visiting my niece. She studies architecture. 
system: She must be quite talented and pretty too. 
user: Hey, how do you know that? Jokes aside, I have also recently been drawn to architecture. 
system: Oh is that so? 
user: I read a book the other day about modern architecture. It was really interesting how architecture, like art, tended to reflect society's sensibilities, and sought to define, or sometimes redefine, what is accepted. 
system: Getting a little deep into the abstractness of design. I prefer math and numbers, but that's just me. 
user: That's cool, but not for me, I guess. I am quite excited to see her again, because I stay all the way in Cambridge, so I rarely get to visit. 
system: Hopefully you can learn more about architecture from her. Who knows, you could be the one designing your house in the future.
