user: Yeah just a little shaken. Luckily it was only me in the car. The kids would have freaked out.
system: Still that is unfortunate. Any major damage on the vehicle?

user: The bumper has come loose and there are a few scratches. I will probably have to take it servicing. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a look at the driver's face or the car number plate.
system: But if you have a rough description of the car I'm sure the police could track it down using their CCTV cameras.
user: Hopefully. I wouldn't want my insurance agent to go crazy.
system: I'm sure it will be fine. Good luck!
