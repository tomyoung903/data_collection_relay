system: You can buy a sweater or scarf for them so that they can use in winter.

system: Maybe you can send them a massage chair! 
user: Good idea! Any brand of massage chair that you recommend?
system: You can check out the movable OTO Capsule CP-01 Massage Chair. It provides human-hand-like therapeutic techniques with 5 auto-massage programs. However, it costs 1300 pounds which is quite expensive.
user: This is really suitable! Although it is expensive but at least it's quality can be promised. Where is the physical store? I can visit it with my parents!
