user: should I bring an umbrella?
system: well it is always good to have an umbrella on hand, but the chance of raining is only 20% for that day, and the journey is mostly sheltered.
user: alright, anything else to take note?
system: oh right... remember the museum only open on the weekdays!
user: Thanks for the reminder, or I would have planned a trip during the weekend...
system: no problem!
