user: I miss eating at asian oriental restaurants. 
system: Perhaps it is time for a visit then. 
user: My grandmother used to take my family all the time but she hasn't since her favourite place has closed down. 
system: That is a shame. 
user: Maybe I should find a new place that is just as good and then bring her to it instead. 
system: I think she would like that very much.
