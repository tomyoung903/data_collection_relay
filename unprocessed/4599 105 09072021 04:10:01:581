user: My horoscope reading just told me that Thursday is going to be a terrible day. 
system: Do you really believe in such mythological devices? 
user: Yes, I have always followed their advices and it has worked out pretty well for me.  
system: To each their own, I just find it hard to believe that the position of stars when you were born really affects your life. 
user: We can't explain everything in this world. They have mystical connections. I should be really careful on Thursday, maybe I should be out of here and go to another town. 
system: Wow you are taking this really seriously aren't you.
