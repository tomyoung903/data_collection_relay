user: Honestly, it's great that 4-star hotels can be affordable too. It's so difficult to find good accommodation nowadays. I hope my family enjoys the trip. 
system: Hmm, yea you've got a point there. It does seem like price points are high for quality hotels. I guess Allenbell is a gem to be treasured! Have a fun trip!
