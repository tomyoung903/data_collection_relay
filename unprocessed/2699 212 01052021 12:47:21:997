user: Sure do! I am excited.
system: Oh no, I am not able to find anything. Do you want to give them a call?
user: Oh dear, I might just give them a call then. I do not want to leave my pet outside alone while I am inside the restaurant.
system: I hope they do not do that and let them in with you.
user: Oh dear, I am worried.
system: Don't worry, just give them a call and ask. Ask me if you need another place to dine in! Have an amazing one.
