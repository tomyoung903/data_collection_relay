user: Do you think it’s awkward travelling alone? 
system: I am sure it won’t be. You can talk to people that are also alone at the museum. You might end up being friends. 
user: I hope they are willing to make friends with strangers! 
system: You can approach them with a smile! You can sense it if they are unwilling and you can move on to the next one. 
user: That’s a good advice. I will try. 
system: Just be yourself! I am sure you will benefit from this trip to the museum!
