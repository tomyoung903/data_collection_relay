system: Oh, are you not from around here? 
user: Nope. I am just backpacking around Europe. This my second last destination before I head off to Scandinavia. 
system: Ah, I see. Where are you from? 
user: I'm from Mexico.  
system: That's nice. What brought you backpacking around Europe?

user: Oh definitely.  Europe is so different from my country. I'm always excited to explore more. 
system: I hope you find the north exciting.
