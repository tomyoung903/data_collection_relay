user: I wanted to visit London this weekend but there was an emergency at work. 
system: I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you could visit some other time? 
user: Yes. My boss did give me a few days off work to compensate for my overtime this weekend. 
system: Oh, which days do you have off work? 
user: The next three days, actually. But I'm busy until Tuesday. 
system: Well, you could leave then, take a short break.
