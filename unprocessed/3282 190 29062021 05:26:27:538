user: I have a large group of friends coming over to visit me. I wonder if it is going to be hard to accommodate all of them. 
system: Do not worry, the restaurant should be able to provide tables for all of you. If they can't fit you in one table, rest assured that they will put all of you side by side so that you guys still can communication with one another.
