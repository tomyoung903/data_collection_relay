user: I feel that fresh graduates lack work experience when they first enter the workforce.  
system: College is a great place for students to gain knowledge, skills and experience. Its also a fantastic opportunity to go for internship and gain work experience. 
user: I agree. I feel that they are not picking up the skills fast enough! 
system: I am sure it will take time! They must possess the ability to adapt and learn fast! 
user: I cannot disagree any further but there are some graduates that are slower than others.  
system: I think it doesn't matter if they are slow but they must have the correct and right mindset to be willing to learn. Some requires more time than rest!
