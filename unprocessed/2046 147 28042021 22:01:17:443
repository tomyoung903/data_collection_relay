user: That's a great idea. What is the cost for getting a car for 5 days?
system: Due to the large number of people the only option is an SUV. Those come by for around $100 per day.
user: That's too expensive!!! I guess I'll have to stick with public transport. Is it better to commute using the train system or buses?
system: While trains are economical, they take more time when compared to buses
