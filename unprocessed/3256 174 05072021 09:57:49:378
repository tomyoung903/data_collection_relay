user: Not really, but I am feeling hungry. 
system: Are you hungry because because it's dinner time? 
user: I don't think the timing matters! I had an heavy lunch earlier and I am now starving. 
system: If that's the case, I believe that your body had finished using the energy you gained from your lunch. Now your body requires more energy to burn, that's why you're feeling hungry! 
user: At this rate that I am eating, wouldn't I gain too much weight? 
system: You won't! You will only gain weight if you consume more calories. As long as you move as much as you eat, you won't gain weight! Don't worry! Go and have your dinner! Do not starve yourself!
