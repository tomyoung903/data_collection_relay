user: I am at the Buckingham Palace. Where is the nearest train station?
system: The nearest cinema is St. James's Park station, about 1 kilometre away. Would you like to get walking directions?
user: Yes, please.
system: You would have to walk along Birdcage Walk with St. James's Park on your left as you walk. Turn right and cross the road towards Queen Anne's Gate. Continue walking straight and you should be able to see St. James's Park station.
user: Thank you so much!
system: You are welcome!
