user: I can't believe dinosaurs once roamed the earth. 
system: What is so hard to believe about that? 
user: I think it might be all those movies, they potray dinosaur to be like something in the league of monsters and not so much creatures. 
system: That's true, they are always the main character in many monster movies but in reality they probably behave and sounded very different. 
user: That's what I thought as well, but then again I am not an expert myself so I can't say for sure. 
system: Well I am sure there are many sources for you to find out. 
user: Hmm maybe a museum would be a good choice to check out more information about these fascinating creatures.  
system: Absolutely! Sounds like a perfect plan to me.
