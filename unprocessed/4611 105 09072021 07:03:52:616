user: I think museums should get more funding. 
system: Do you feel that they are getting too little now? 
user: Yes. Many museums I visited have very little money so they look a little dilapidated. Except for the big ones of course. 
system: I mean they are not really generating revenues right, so naturally no one wants to really invest in them. 
user: That's the whole point of it right, because it has no revenue it should get more money. I think they are important for our national identity and cultural understanding. 
system: I guess that really depends on what you think government budget should be used for.
