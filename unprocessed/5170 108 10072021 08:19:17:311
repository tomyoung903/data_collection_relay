user: My wives and I have been living seperately for quite awhile now. 
system: I heard long distance relationship may be harder to maintain. I hope yours are going well. 
user: I think it's fine. It's mainly due to work and that they all don't know each other. 
system: Work is unfortunately difficult to avoid. How about try introducing them to one another? 
user: They will be coming over to my place on wednesday. I will introduce them then. 
system: That's convenient. Personally, I prefer people coming to my place than me going to theirs.
