user: Phew. I caught up with my friends this weekend. It was a wild time. 
system: Oh, really? That sounds fun. 
user: It was! But now I need to cleanse my system for a couple of days. I'm too old to be hungover. 
system: Haha. Have a light meal, it should help. 
user: Oh, I did, but my stomach is still roiling. Still, it's been fun. Getting back home this Saturday is going to be depressing. 
system: Well, I hope you return and get a chance to catch up with your friends soon!
