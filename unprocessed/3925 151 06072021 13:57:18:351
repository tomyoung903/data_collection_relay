user: It's alright. I just got a summons in my mail. 
system: Oh no. What did it say? 
user: Apparently, I was caught speeding on the highway.  
system: I see. Do you agree with the summons? 
user: Can't say I wasn't speeding. I was going quite fast on that day. 
system: Why is that? 
user: I really, really needed to use a washroom. Seemed like whatever we had for staff dinner at work was not good for the tummy. 
system: Ah, I see. Get to the station and submit your fine asap.
