user: I have been travelling and working a lot these days. I really need a break.
system: Get some sleep today. Don't stress yourself out.
user: I know some people prefer changing hotels during their stay in town, but I would prefer staying in one room for the entire trip.
system: Is it because they want to try each different hotel every day? 
user: Yes, that could be fun if people are on vocations, such as coastal islands and beaches, but for now, I am exhausted.
system: Do you like beaches?
user: I like them, but I prefer hiking and mountains.
system: That sounds like a good option for weekends.
