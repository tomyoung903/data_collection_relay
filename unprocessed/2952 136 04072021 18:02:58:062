user: I'm doing a research about education so I need a lot of information about the schools in the area. 
system: I think you can learn a lot by visiting the colleges.  
user: I agree. There may be libraries full of research materials there. 
system: You can also go around observing the professors conduct lessons. I think it's a great way to gain insight and it is less boring that way as well. 
user: Great idea! I'm going to try that! 
system: No problem! Though there may be some lessons that may be boring though!
