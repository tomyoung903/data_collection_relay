user: Nope, I'm good! I was wondering why do people love to take photographs so much these days? 
system: Well... Taking photographs or videos of your love ones are effective ways to store them for you to look back on the days to come! 
user: However when cameras are involved, people actions wouldn't be as genuine as they would be off camera - wouldn't that be rather fake? They would pretend and even exaggerate simple notions.  
system: That isn't entirely wrong, so I urge you to use the best lens and that are your eyes - no technology can beat them. Hence, you should cherish your eyes to capture these precious memories! 
user: Alright! I will take care of my eyes well! 
system: Great! Take a 5 minute break every 30 minutes to rest your eyes from technology so that your tired eyes can rest!
