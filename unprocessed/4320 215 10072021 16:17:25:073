user: can i also ask what's the dress code like? I don't want to be underdressed for the restaurant. 
system: I believe smart casual is adequate for the restaurant. 
user: what if i'm dressed way more formal than smart casual? 
system: You might stand out a little more. is it because you have plans in the hotel before that? 
user: yes, i do. i actually have a conference meeting with some members of a club i'm in and i need to be properly dressed. 
system: oh, well, you could change before leaving for the restaurant. 
user: i'm not too sure how long the meeting will last. i'm afraid i have to rush for the taxi. 
system: oh i see. you could change if you have extra time but i'm sure more formal would be fine at the restaurant too.
