user: Did you know? I love greek cuisines very very much! 
system: Really? What do you like about it? 
user: Hmm, I'm not entirely sure myself. I guess It's because they use a lot of olive oil and I love it! 
system: Olive oil sounds good! I personally love many types of oil because of fried food. 
user: The gardenia restaurant is one of the best at greek cuisines, I heard. 
system: That must mean it serves very good food! Maybe I should try it sometime.
