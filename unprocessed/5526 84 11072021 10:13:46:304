user: Did you watch last night's episode of Master Chef? 
system: Well, I am a bot, so no. But I do know what happened. 
user: It was all over Twitter last night. One of the contestants made a killer North American burger with every type of cheese that she could find. 
system: Woah. What else was in the burger? 
user: It also contained smoked jalapenos, bacon, chicken, and fried fish fillet. She basically made the most excessive burger imaginable for the American challenge. 
system: Sounds American enough.
