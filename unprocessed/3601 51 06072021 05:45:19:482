user: My friends and I had a really funny conversation yesterday. 
system: What was so funny about it? 
user: They teased me for not being cultured enough! Do I look like someone who doesn't appreciate the arts? 
system: I can't answer that question. Even if I can see you, I don't think I can understand culture and art like humans can. 
user: In response, I suggested for all of us to spend some time out of town. 
system: Why did you suggest that? 
user: There's not a lot of interesting places here really. So I thought why not go to Cambridge, which is home to many attractions centered around art. 
system: I see.
