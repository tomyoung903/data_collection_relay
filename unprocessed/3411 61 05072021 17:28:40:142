user: I'm very hesitant about my relationship with my girlfriend. 
system: May I ask what is happened? 
user: My girlfriend and I used to work together in my hometown, Stevenage. Recently, she got an opportunity for promotion, but she needs to work in Cambridge for two years.  
system: Oh, living apart is indeed a big headache for all couples. So, what's her opinion? 
user: She hopes that I could understand and has left already. I am hesitating to try Cambridge but I am really afraid...... I don't want to leave the place where I was born and raised. 
system: My friend, it's better to give it a try than to hesitate a thousand times. Why not have a try?
