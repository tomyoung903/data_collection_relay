user: Why can't things be cheaper? Finding good deal is so difficult nowadays.
system: A sudden change of heart? Don't tell me you regret your expensive decision.
user: No.. I'm only willing to spend this much because my family hasn't been on a vacation for so long and I want them to have a good time.
system: I'm sure your family would appreciate it. Maybe you could find some activities to do together as a family during your stay.
user: Yeah that's a good idea. Thanks for the suggestion!
