user: Life has been so boring! I've been lying in the hotel bed all day and doing absolutely nothing! 
system: Hotel? You're on a vacation now?  
user: Well not really, my parents and I are on a staycation, at Ashley Hotel. It's really boring to stay in here all day but I just can't figure out where to go! 
system: Hmm, maybe you can bring them to a nice restaurant! I'm sure they would appreciate it. 
user: Good idea! My parents mentioned that they really wanna try the seafood at a restaurant nearby! Maybe I'll bring them there. 
system: Why not! They would definitely enjoy it!
