user: Well, it would be really convenient for us if it's near the place we're staying at.  
system: I am unable to do so. 
user: Oh well. It's alright. We'll figure out something else then.  
system: Are you planning a trip with your friends? All eight of you? 
user: No, I wish I had that many friends. I only have 2 friends. 
system: It's okay, one does not need a lot of friends to be happy. Then, a vacation with your family? 
user: Yes. Was looking forward to 5 nights just chilling. But sadly had to reduce the number of nights. 
system: 4 nights is still a great choice! You can spend the last night preparing for the day ahead.  
user: Agreed. That's the plan. 
system: Brilliant!
