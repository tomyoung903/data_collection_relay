user: Hello! I've recently taken part in an exchange program at my school! 
system: Seems interesting! Do you like making friends? 
user: Yes, I sure do love meeting new people! I'm bringing some Thai students around this time! 
system: That sounds exciting!  
user: They have been really hospitable when I visited Thailand last year! I hope I can do the same for them! 
system: I sure do hope they enjoy their time! 
user: I'm looking to bring them for some Thai food first then touring them around the city for the rest of the day! 
system: Sounds like a great plan!
