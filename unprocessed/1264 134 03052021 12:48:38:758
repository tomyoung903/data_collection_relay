user: Nope, that's all. By the way, I haven't had the chance to catch a movie in such a long time.
system: Why is that?
user: There's a pandemic going on so a lot of places are closed and not accessible to the public.
system: That sounds terrible, how are you coping?
user: It's tough but thankfully not everything is closed so there's still a few things to do.
system: I am sure that it won't last too long and that things will get back to normal soon.
