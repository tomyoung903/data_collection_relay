user: It is the first time my friend, Ben, has tried Indian food. It was difficult to get him to try new food since he's only willing to eat swiss food.
system: It is good to try new things. It's great that you managed to convince him to try new foods.
user: Right. Indian food is very delicious. He is missing out.
system: The area north of town serves many other delicious foods as well. You should get Ben to try them out.
user: Will do! Let's see if Ben likes Indian food first.
system: Have fun!
