user: I'm so tired. I just got back from a long day of shopping. 
system: Did you have a lot you needed to buy?
user: No, I just enjoy shopping a lot in general. But I did have to run some errands and pick up a few things today. I had to go all over town. 
system: Do you enjoy retail therapy more than online shopping? 
user: Slightly. Only because it serves as my only form of cardio. I need to keep myself in shape. 
system: Oh, so you get your exercise from running errands. That's quite a productive use of your time. 
user: That's right. Not to mention it makes me happy to go on a shopping trip on my own, kind of like a date with myself. 
system: I'm glad to hear that you're practicing good self-care. 
user: That's right. I'm going for a trip with my family soon. I'm quite excited for the train ride to Cambridge. I haven't been on one in a long time.
system: That sounds nice. I hope you enjoy yourself the whole time. Are you all set?
user: Not quite.
system: Oh dear. No worries. I'll get you the help you need.
