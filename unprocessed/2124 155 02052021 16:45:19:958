user: A movie night sounds great. Should I download some movies on Netflix? I can't decide what to watch though.
system: Would you like me to suggest some movies?
user: I think it's ok for now. I can ask my friends what genre they prefer later.
system: Ok. Don't worry about having to download the movies, the free wifi at the Hamilton Lodge is sufficient for you to stream them.
user: Alright. Thank you for your help. That's all I need for now.
system: You're welcome. Enjoy your stay!
