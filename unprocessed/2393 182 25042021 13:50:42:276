user: I'm more of a contemporary art kind of person. I can't really connect with modern art.
system: I see. What do you think of Takashi Murakami ?
user: He's quite an influential figure in the Japanese contemporary art scene. While i can't really relate to the sexualized nature in his art, I like his theory about the superflat.
system: He is quite a controversial figure in art, but perhaps that is the essence of art. I hope you enjoy yourself at Cambridge Artworks.
