user: err wait, can I do a walk-in booking? I almost forgot, lol. Everyone's so pumped so I wanna make sure the trip is smooth sailing even tho the trip is so impromptu. We haven't even started packing, everything's so last minute!
system: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but there are strictly no walk-ins. If y'all are too busy, I can actually book the rooms for you. It'll be done in a blink of an eye. Easy-peasy. 
user: sigh, such a hassle. ok, I will update you again later. 
system: Hope to hear from you soon! Don't be shy, I'm here to help you anytime.
