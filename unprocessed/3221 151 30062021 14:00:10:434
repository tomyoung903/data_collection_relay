user: Not for now I am calling in the pest control for my home 
system: You've been having any issues with pests lately? 
user: Yeah. Just yesterday we had so many ants under the kitchen sink. We've also been spotting a few baby cockroaches around lately. 
system: Oh my. That is quite disturbing. 
user: Yeah. Sometimes my kids scream and I have to run and check if they are okay. More often than not it's just some weird bug which frightens them. 
system: It will be frightening for many people at any age 
user: Yeah. I try to put on a brave face in front of them. But sometimes even I get scared. That's why I brought in the pest control people to spray the house 
system: When are they coming over? 
user: This weekend. It was not the usual time we do pest control so we are not prepared to move for the required days away from home. 
system: I understand. Either way, I'm sure 3 stars should be comfortable.
