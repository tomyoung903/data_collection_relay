user: My child is graduating soon but he is a person that prefers status quo.  
system: Visiting a college will be an excellent opportunity for him to experience and gain firsthand knowledge of what student life will be like so that hopefully he will be more prepared next time! 
user: I am scared that he is afraid to make new friends as he doesn't like changes. 
system: Change can be a scary thing for many people. It's a psychology barrier for them. They should try to step our of their comfort zone and things would gradually become better! 
user: I hope I can help him with stepping out of his comfort zone 
system: Parents plays an important role in helping their kids too! You can try to talk and spend time with him and have a positive mindset. I am sure this will be beneficial to his growth!
