user: I am bringing my professor from the college there for a meal. 
system: I  believe he will enjoy the meals there. 
user: I hope so. My mark for my final year project all depends on him. 
system: Maybe you can try to work hard on your project instead of taking him for a meal. 
user: But it's so hard to fulfill all his requirements. 
system: Try your best on that. God helps those who help themselves
