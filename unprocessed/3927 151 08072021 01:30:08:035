user: It's okay. My son just got accepted into University. 
system: That's great, congratulations. Which university did he get accepted into? 
user: One of the best universities here. The University of Cambridge. 
system: Oh wow. That's amazing. Your son must be very happy. 
user: He is. We were just having our family dinner when he received the email from the college. 
system: Was it unexpected? 
user: I don't think so. He's a pretty smart kid. He already got offers from other uni's but we were really waiting for Cambridge. The timing was unexpected. I would imagine they would send an email in the morning.  
system: Still, some email is better than no email. 
user: Yeah definitely. We are pretty happy. But now we need to rush to get him there in time for orientation. The entire family is coming to drop him off. I'm not sure if I should book a car just in case. 
system: Don't worry, the train will get you guys to Cambridge on time.
