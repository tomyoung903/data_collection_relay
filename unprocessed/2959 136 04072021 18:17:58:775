user: Work is very busy nowadays that I even have to travel out to the south to attend a meeting with my team. 
system: Oh no. Good luck with your work. Is the hotel close enough to your work place? 
user: Luckily it is. The meetings start early and end late. I'm going to pass out from exhaustion if I still have to continue working back at the hotel. 
system: At least the hotel has free wifi that you can use. Hopefully the wifi connection speed won't hinder your work. 
user: I sure do hope so.  
system: Good luck with your work! You can do this!
