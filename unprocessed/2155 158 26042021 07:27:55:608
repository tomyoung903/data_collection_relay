user: Can you suggest some restaurants to compensate my empty pocket money :( 
system: I bet the price of Catalan styled food is just like clouds of the sky. Its beautiful but untouchable. So try Spanish!
user: La tasca restaurant? Ive heard about that for Spainish. 
system: Yep. Food there is not very expensive. I dont know if u like it, though im loven the authentic flavour over there. Just have a try lah.
