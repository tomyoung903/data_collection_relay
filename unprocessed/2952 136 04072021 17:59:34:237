system: That's a good idea. It's always good to stay near a relative. 
user: Right? I will start by looking around the free one since my pay has yet to come in and I'm broke. But I don't want to burden my grandmother by staying at her place so I will get alternate housing for now.

user: I'll go check it in person first. 
system: Okay, good luck!
