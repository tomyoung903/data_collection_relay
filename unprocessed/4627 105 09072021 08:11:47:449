user: My internship company just changed my job location I am so upset. 
system: I mean it is not always within their control after all. 
user: What do you mean it isn't, of course it is! And the thing is they should have informed me way earlier instead of such a last minute change. 
system: Okay I am so sorry about that, it is indeed very unpleasant to get last minute changes. 
user: Now I have to travel to Broxbourne, which is really far from my home. 
system: Is there no room for negotiation, perhaps another role at the original place.
