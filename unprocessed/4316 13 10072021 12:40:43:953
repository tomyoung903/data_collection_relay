user: It's the busiest and most tiring time of the year again. 
system: You sound unhappy, what happened? 
user: Work always gets hectic around this time each year. Similar to previous years, I'm being sent out again for business trips. 
system: I'm sorry to hear that. Remember to take good care of your body. 
user: I will, thanks. At least I will have a colleague with me this time.  
system: I see. 
user: Well, no use feeling sad over it. I sure will miss Broxbourne and its food, though. 
system: Good luck. I hope you'll be able to come back as soon as possible.
