user: Shit I forgot that Tuesday is my wedding anniversary. 
system: Have you done nothing in preparation at all. 
user: Nope I am so screwed my husband is going to kill me, he was always particular about such things. 
system: Well I am sure you still have time to make up for it. 
user: Well the main problem is I have a meeting at another place starting on Tuesday so I won't even be with him. 
system: uh oh, erm I guess an expensive gift and a sincere apology afterwards.
